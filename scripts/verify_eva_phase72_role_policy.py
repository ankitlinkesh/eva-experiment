"""Standalone verifier for Phase 72 (per-role tool containment).

The permission gate classifies per TOOL, globally: `file.write_text` costs the
same whoever asks. That is right for a single actor and wrong for a delegated
sub-task, because a research sub-task reads UNTRUSTED CONTENT -- a web page can
ask it to do anything -- and the gate has no way to say "this one may read the
web and must never touch the screen".

Phase 72 adds the missing dimension (role x tool -> GREEN/ORANGE/RED) as a
CONTAINMENT layer, not a second gate. What this verifies:

  1. NO ACTIVE ROLE = NO CHANGE. Ordinary console/planner calls are untouched;
     this layer only exists inside a delegated sub-task.
  2. RED REALLY REFUSES, and refuses BEFORE the handler. It also reports the
     attempt as an injection signal -- a research role reaching for
     screen.click is evidence that content it read tried to reach an actuator.
  3. THE REFUSAL DOES NOT ECHO ARGUMENTS. A refusal caused by injected content
     must not relay that content back to the user (the Phase 68 lesson behind
     confirmation.py's explicit key list).
  4. THE ROLE CARRIES NO CALLER AUTHORITY. role/_role/agent_role kwargs are
     stripped exactly like confirmed/_approved/content_args, because a caller
     that names its own role just claims whichever role unlocks the tool.
  5. IT FAILS CLOSED. An unknown role is RED on everything; a newly registered
     tool is RED for every role until someone declares it.
  6. GREEN IS NOT A BYPASS. A tool that is GREEN for a role is still classified
     by the gate exactly as it would be with no role at all. If GREEN could
     lower friction, this file would be a self-authorization channel of the
     same shape as the stripped `confirmed` flag.
  7. ORANGE STRICTLY DOMINATES PHASE 42. Role escalation is applied AFTER trust
     calibration, so an ORANGE action can never be handed back and auto-allowed
     for prior approvals.
  8. THE ESCALATION ONLY EVER RAISES, and never touches hard_block.
  9. NO GHOST ENTRIES. Every declared tool name is a real registered tool -- a
     misspelled GREEN entry would silently leave the intended tool RED while
     the policy still read as permissive.

Fully offline: no network, no LLM, no real filesystem writes. Every tool that
could actually do something is replaced by a probe handler, so a REGRESSION in
this file cannot itself cause an action.
