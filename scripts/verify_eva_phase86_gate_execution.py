"""Standalone verifier for Phase 86 (gate execution honesty).

Found during the gate stress-test, driving gated tools through real ledger
approval:

Bug A -- a successful screen capture was reported as a failure. `_with_execution`
in confirmation.py decides success via `executed.get("ok")`, but `_capture_screen`
in registry.py returned a dict with NO `ok` key. So approving `capture_screen`
fell into the failure branch and answered "I confirmed `act_...`, but execution
did not complete." even though the screenshot was taken and saved to disk. Fixed
by adding `"ok": True` to `_capture_screen`'s returned dict, matching the
convention every other tool follows.

Bug B -- a gated call missing a required arg crashed on approval. `screen.observe`
requires `reason` in its args_schema, but `ToolRegistry.run` never validates
args_schema before creating the gated pending -- so issuing it without `reason`
still creates a pending. On approval, `run_approved` reached
`self._invoke(spec, dict(stored["args"]))`, which calls `spec.handler(**args)`
and raised `TypeError: missing 1 required positional argument: 'reason'` -- an
unhandled crash AFTER the user already approved the action. Fixed by wrapping
only that final call inside `run_approved` in try/except, converting the crash
into a clean `{"ok": False, "error": ...}` the confirm handoff reports as "did
not complete" -- the normal (ungated) run path still calls `_invoke` directly
and is unaffected.

What this verifies:
  1. An approved `capture_screen` reports success end to end (real ledger flow).
  2. `_capture_screen()` itself returns `ok: True`.
  3. `run_approved` on a malformed stored call (missing required arg) returns a
     clean `ok: False` + error instead of raising.

Fully offline and DETERMINISTIC: the screen capture is stubbed, because
`_capture_screen` raises when the display cannot be grabbed (screen locked, or
under load during a long suite run) and Fix B then correctly turns that into
ok:False -- which is exactly the intended honest-failure path, not the behaviour
under test here ("a SUCCESSFUL capture reports success"). A first version of this
check drove a real screenshot and passed in isolation but flaked inside the full
4-minute sweep for exactly that reason; stubbing removes the live-hardware
dependency.
