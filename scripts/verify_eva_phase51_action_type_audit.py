"""Standalone verifier for Phase 51 (the auto-allow audit).

Two real bugs shipped with one root cause: **the safe-looking default is the
dangerous one**. Omit ``action_type`` on a ToolSpec and it silently becomes
``SAFE_LOCAL_READ`` = ALLOW-class, and nothing complains. That is how
``capture_screen`` ended up screenshotting the user with no confirmation while
the correctly-typed ``screen.observe`` sat gated and unreachable, and how
``desktop_observe`` ended up letting the model unlock pixel capture with a
caller-supplied flag. A permission gate whose default is "allow" fails open.

This verifier makes that class of bug impossible to introduce silently:

  1. NO UNAUDITED AUTO-ALLOW: every tool typed SAFE_LOCAL_READ must appear in
     the explicitly reviewed AUDITED_SAFE_LOCAL_READ list. A new tool that
     forgets action_type now FAILS THE BUILD instead of quietly becoming
     unguarded.
  2. Every action_type is a real ActionType (a typo would silently be
     unclassified, i.e. auto-allowed).
  3. NO ALLOW-CLASS TOOL HAS A PIXEL PATH — the Phase 50 regression, pinned:
     every screen-capturing tool is override-class and privileged (so the Phase
     40 injection defense covers it), and desktop_observe exposes no screen
     switch.
  4. Honest metadata: network tools say NETWORK_ACTION, local writes do not
     claim to be reads. Both are allow-class exactly as before, so this is
     truth-in-labelling, not a gate change.
  5. GATE-PRESERVING: the relabelling changed no tool's class. Pinned by exact
     counts so a future edit cannot quietly loosen the gate.
  6. The audited list means what it claims: nothing in it is a known-dangerous
     tool.

Fully offline: no network, no LLM, no execution.

# The gate classes as they stand. Pinned so a future change that loosens the
# gate has to say so out loud rather than drift.
# Phase 62: confirm 7 -> 8 for the new "screen.submit_form" tool (fill+submit a
# form staged from the trusted console; confirm-class, SAFE_LOCAL_UI).
# Phase 70: four unrouted duplicate tools were deleted, so the totals fall by
# exactly four -- allow 84 -> 83 (`app.open`, SAFE_LOCAL_UI) and override
# 12 -> 9 (`app.close_request` SYSTEM_CHANGE, `file.read_text`
# PRIVACY_FILE_READ, `file.patch_text` DESTRUCTIVE_FILE_ACTION); confirm is
# unchanged. Deleting a tool only ever removes capability, and no surviving
# tool moved to a weaker class -- which is the direction this pin guards.
#
# Phase 74 added exactly one tool, `shell.run_bounded` (SYSTEM_CHANGE,
# safety_level dangerous), taking override 9 -> 10 with allow and confirm
# unchanged. The movement is toward MORE friction, the direction this pin
# allows; it guards against a surviving tool sliding into a weaker class.
# Phase 82 moved close_app from allow -> confirm (requires_confirmation=True):
# closing an app can discard unsaved work, so it now asks first. allow 83->82,
# confirm 8->9.
