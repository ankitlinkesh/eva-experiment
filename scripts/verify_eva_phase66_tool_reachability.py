"""Standalone verifier for Phase 66: no registered tool may be stranded.

Five times now a capability shipped registered, gated, and documented -- and
wired to NOTHING, so it could never actually run in production. Concretely:
``voice.listen_once`` existed since Phase 49b and nothing called it until
Phase 61 wired it up. ``app.focus`` was registered and gated and reachable
from nowhere until Phase 64. Both shipped "green" many phases apart, because
every test that exercised them called the function directly -- the gap was
that no PRODUCTION path did. Tests proved the tool WORKS; nothing proved
anything could ever REACH it.

WHAT "REACHABLE" ACTUALLY MEANS -- READ THIS BEFORE TOUCHING THE METHOD

This verifier is deliberately NOT about whether a tool is *callable*.
``/api/tools/{tool_name}`` calls ``tools.run(tool_name, **body)`` for ANY
registered tool, so every one of the 100 tools this file examines is already
callable in principle through that generic, header-guarded endpoint. That is
exactly the shape of the ``listen_once``/``app.focus`` bug: both were
callable in principle the whole time; nothing in the product ever chose to
call them. So the question this file answers is narrower and harder: does
something in the FIXED, shipped product -- a console command handler, a
capability router, a form filler, a default action tag on the tool's own
observation record -- actually ROUTE to this tool for some real situation?
A tool being technically reachable through a generic pass-through (the HTTP
endpoint, or a user-authored "skill" that can name any tool at all) does not
answer that question, because nothing in FIXED code decided to call that
*specific* tool -- the name came from outside, the same way it would for any
other tool. Keep that distinction in mind before treating a new kind of
"mention" as evidence.

THE INVARIANT

Every tool in ``ToolRegistry._tools`` must be reachable by at least one of:

  (a) planner-visible -- its name appears in ``reg.planner_specs()`` under
      the UNION of flag states we check here (default env, and
      ``EVA_V2_PLAYWRIGHT_ENABLED=true``), or
  (b) referenced by production source -- its name appears as an exact
      string-literal constant in a non-test, non-verifier Python module
      other than ``registry.py`` or ``roadmap/catalog.py`` (see EXCLUSIONS
      below for why those two specifically are disqualified), e.g. the
      console handlers in ``eva/core/fast_commands.py``.

"Production source" here means every ``.py`` file under ``backend/eva/``
except the two exclusions. Tests (``backend/tests/``) and verifiers
(``scripts/verify_*.py``) are excluded on purpose: a test calling a tool
proves the tool WORKS, not that anything in the shipped product can ever
reach it -- that conflation is exactly how the five prior bugs shipped
green.

EXCLUSIONS, AND WHY EACH ONE EXISTS

  * ``eva/tools/registry.py`` -- every tool's own ``ToolSpec`` entry lives
    here, so its name necessarily appears here regardless of whether
    anything else in the product ever calls it. Counting it would make
    every tool trivially "reachable".

  * ``eva/roadmap/catalog.py`` -- added after this verifier's first
    real-world use caught the same laundering pattern in a new costume.
    The first version of this file counted a catalog.py entry as a valid
    production reference, and it looked plausible: ``app.open`` and
    ``screen.click`` both have ``ExecutionBoundary`` entries there, so both
    looked "referenced". But ``get_execution_boundary_catalog()`` is
    declarative metadata read by the ``eva execution boundaries`` report --
    it does not route a call, any more than a comment does. Two genuinely
    stranded tools (``app.open`` and ``file.patch_text``, see below) were
    masked behind exactly this: an ``ExecutionBoundary`` entry that made the
    scan count them as referenced while nothing in the product actually
    called them. Counting a catalog OF tools as a caller of those tools is
    circular by construction -- it always mentions every tool it documents,
    whether or not anything routes to it -- so it is excluded here the same
    way ``registry.py`` is, and for the same reason: a file whose entire
    purpose is to enumerate tool names is not evidence that any of them are
    used.

  Other files that classify or describe tools without calling them were
  spot-checked while investigating the catalog.py masking (a security
  audit's classification sets in ``eva/security/action_audit.py``; the
  "agents" framework's capability-to-agent-class discovery metadata in
  ``eva/agents/*.py``, which is explicitly documented elsewhere in that
  package as "discovery metadata only" and not yet real execution). None of
  those turned out to be any tool's *only* production reference -- every
  tool touched by them also has a real caller elsewhere -- so excluding them
  did not change the computed set. That was checked, not assumed, but it is
  also not a closed question: a file structured like ``catalog.py`` (mentions
  many tool names, calls none of them) is a standing risk for this scan
  method in general, and a future one could mask a new stranded tool the
  same way until someone excludes it too. This verifier's method is a proxy
  for "something routes to it", not a proof; treat any new exclusion the way
  ``catalog.py`` was added here -- with a specific, checked reason, not a
  standing allowance for "descriptive-looking" files in general.

HOW THIS DIFFERS FROM test_planner_reachability.py

``backend/tests/test_planner_reachability.py`` already exists and asserts
the OPPOSITE, security-facing direction: that ``screen.*``/``web.*``/``mcp.*``
tools are *not* planner-visible by default (some of that invisibility is
permanent and deliberate -- ``screen.*`` must never be planner-reachable
regardless of flags, because giving an LLM planner direct mouse/keyboard
control is a standing safety decision, not a gap). This verifier asserts the
complementary invariant: every tool REGISTERED in ``ToolRegistry._tools``
is reachable by *some* production path, planner or otherwise. A tool can
correctly satisfy ``test_planner_reachability.py`` (permanently hidden from
the planner) while still needing to pass THIS verifier via a production
caller -- e.g. ``screen.click`` is planner-invisible by design, but reachable
through ``eva/screen/form_filler.py``'s ``run("screen.click", ...)`` call.
Both files must keep passing; neither subsumes the other.

METHOD, AND ITS LIMITATIONS

The scan is AST-based, not a text grep: for every production file (outside
the two exclusions above) we parse the module and collect every
``ast.Constant`` string node's exact value. A tool name counts as referenced
only if some string literal in the file is EXACTLY EQUAL to it -- not merely
containing it as a substring. Two consequences fall out of that for free,
both confirmed against real instances found while writing this verifier:

  * Comments are invisible. The tokenizer strips them before the parser
    ever builds a node, so a comment like
    ``# *** NOT registry.run("screen.click", ...) ***`` (a real comment in
    ``eva/screen/screen_tools.py``) contributes nothing -- correctly, since
    a comment is not a reachable code path. (screen.click has other, real,
    non-comment references, so this particular case was never a false
    negative; it is called out here because it is the concrete case that
    proved the exact-match approach was necessary rather than a plain grep.)
  * A docstring merely MENTIONING a tool name in prose (e.g. "...call
    screen.click to press the button...") does not count, because the full
    string constant does not equal the tool name. A docstring or string
    constant whose ENTIRE value happens to equal a tool name verbatim WOULD
    still count as a reference -- this is a known, accepted imprecision:
    manually auditing all 104 tools while building this verifier found no
    such case, but the exact-match approach cannot structurally rule it out
    for future tools.

Dynamically-built tool names (an f-string, string concatenation, or a name
assembled in a loop) are invisible to this scan by construction -- there is
no string constant equal to the assembled name for the AST walk to find.
The only such case among the tools registered in a default environment is
``mcp.*``: ``eva/mcp/registration.py`` builds MCP tool names as
``f"mcp.{server.name}.{tool_name}"``. This is handled honestly, not papered
over: MCP tool specs are merged into ``self._tools`` only when the MCP
subsystem has actually loaded them (enabled + configured), so in the default
environment this verifier runs in, ``mcp.*`` names are simply ABSENT from
``ToolRegistry._tools`` -- there is nothing to classify as reachable or
unreachable, honestly mirroring what ``test_planner_reachability.py``
already documents about the same cache. ``web.*`` tools are NOT built
dynamically (each is a literal ``ToolSpec`` entry in ``registry.py``) and
are covered by planner-visibility under the Playwright-enabled flag state,
not by this source-scan at all.

THE PIN

``EXPECTED_UNREACHABLE`` is the reviewed set: tool name -> written
justification for why it is intentionally exempt. It is compared to the
computed unreachable set by EXACT MATCH, both directions -- a newly
stranded tool fails the build (it is not yet in the reviewed set), and a
tool that became reachable but is still listed also fails (the list cannot
silently rot into over-broad cover).

As first shipped, the reviewed set had FOUR entries -- a genuine finding, not
a scanner artifact. The first pass at this verifier excluded only
``registry.py`` and treated a ``roadmap/catalog.py`` entry as a valid
reference; under that method only ``app.close_request`` and ``file.read_text``
looked stranded, and both were "fixed" by giving them a catalog entry. That
fix was wrong -- it satisfied the scan without making either tool any more
callable-from-the-product than before (see the EXCLUSIONS section above).
Once ``catalog.py`` was correctly excluded, TWO MORE tools that had been
masked behind their own catalog entry surfaced: ``app.open`` and
``file.patch_text``. All four turned out to be a shadow family of dotted
tools duplicating a working, actually-routed alternative:

  * ``app.close_request`` -> superseded by ``close_app`` (what the console
    "close app"/"close" commands in ``eva/core/fast_commands.py`` route to).
  * ``app.open`` -> superseded by ``open_app`` (planner-visible, and what
    the console "open" commands route to). ``app.open`` itself was not
    broken: Phase 64 gave it a correct ``app_window_open`` postcondition and
    it was live-verified working (``reg.run("app.open", app="notepad")``
    really opened Notepad and correctly reported success) -- it simply had
    no caller.
  * ``file.patch_text`` -> superseded by ``file.write_text`` (its own
    implementation, ``safe_file_tools.file_patch_text``, delegated to
    ``file_write_text`` for the actual write; it was ``file.write_text``, not
    ``file.patch_text``, that other production code actually referenced).
  * ``file.read_text`` -> superseded by ``workspace_read_file``
    (planner-visible, allowlist-bounded, what workspace reads route
    through).

Each was retained deliberately rather than deleted at the time, in case a
future phase wired it up on purpose. Phase 70 revisited that call: no phase
ever did wire any of the four up, each still had a confirmed working
counterpart, and letting a reviewed-but-permanent exemption list stand in
for deletion just gives duplication a paper trail instead of removing it.
Before deleting ``app.open``, its one genuinely load-bearing property -- the
accurate, independently-checked ``app_window_open`` postcondition Phase 64
gave it -- was moved onto ``open_app`` (the tool actually being routed to),
so the routed path gained real verification instead of losing it. All four
tools, their registry entries, and their remaining code paths were deleted;
``EXPECTED_UNREACHABLE`` is now empty and ``EXPECTED_TOOL_COUNT`` dropped
from 104 to 100. ``app.close_request`` was ``SYSTEM_CHANGE`` while its
survivor ``close_app`` stays the less-gated ``SAFE_LOCAL_UI`` -- that
asymmetry was noted, not resolved; risk (re)classification is a separate
decision from reachability and out of scope here.
