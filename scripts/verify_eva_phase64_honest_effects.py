"""Standalone verifier for Phase 64: the agent being lied to by its own
infrastructure.

Four defects, confirmed by running the real code, all sharing one shape -- a
layer reports success for something that did not happen. For a multi-step
agent this compounds: it proceeds to step 2 believing step 1 worked.

  * **Defect 1** -- ``eva.desktop.windows.focus_window`` used a bare
    ``user32.SetForegroundWindow(hwnd)``, which Windows' foreground lock
    blocks from a background process. Measured from a forced clean state
    (Notepad foreground, asked to focus Chrome): the focus never took effect.
    Fixed with the standard AttachThreadInput dance
    (``_try_set_foreground``), plus polling ``get_active_window()`` over a
    short bounded settle window (``_wait_for_focus``) instead of reading it
    immediately -- an immediate read races the window manager and can see a
    real, completed focus change as if it had not happened.
  * **Defect 2** -- ``focus_window`` returned ``ok: True`` regardless of
    whether focus actually happened. Every caller in this codebase treats
    ``result.get("ok") is True`` as proof of success, so this was read as
    success everywhere. Fixed: ``ok`` is now tied to the independently
    verified outcome, with a clear ``error`` and the real foreground window
    in the payload on failure. ``_show_window`` (minimize/maximize/restore)
    had the same pattern (trusting ``ShowWindow``'s return value, which is
    not a success flag -- it reports the window's PREVIOUS visibility) and
    got the same fix.
  * **Defect 3** -- ``eva.tools.postconditions`` declared
    ``app_window_active``/``screen_state_changed``/``text_field_contains``/
    ``url_opened`` as verifiable, but none of them had real logic: all of
    them derived ``verified`` from the tool's own self-reported ``ok`` while
    claiming ``provenance="observed"`` -- laundering a lying tool's lie (like
    the old ``focus_window``) into an apparently independent-looking
    confirmation, returned to the model in every tool result. Fixed:
    ``app_window_active`` now performs a REAL independent check (reads the
    actual foreground window); every other now-honest method reports
    ``provenance="unverified"`` and ``verified=False`` rather than claiming
    an observation nothing here can actually make. ``ToolExecutor`` still
    never fabricates a failure for these (only an INDEPENDENT failure may
    demote ``ok`` -- that logic is untouched).
  * **Defect 4** -- ``ToolExecutor.execute_all`` sliced planned calls with a
    hardcoded, unnamed ``calls[:3]``; anything beyond the third call was
    dropped with no error, no warning, and nothing told to the model or the
    user. Fixed: the cap is now named and configurable
    (``max_tools_per_step()`` / ``EVA_MAX_TOOLS_PER_STEP``, default
    unchanged at 3), and when it actually truncates a plan, an explicit
    result is appended saying so.

Also wires the previously-orphaned ``app.focus`` tool (registered, allow-class,
but reachable from nowhere in backend/eva) into exactly two places: the
typed-console "focus"/"focus window" command, and a focus-restore attempt
inside ``screen_submit_form`` before it aborts on a staged-window mismatch --
the abort remains the fallback if the restore does not fix it.

Fully offline: no network, no LLM, no real mouse/keyboard movement, no real
window is ever focused (every win32-touching seam is monkeypatched), and the
vault + pending-action ledger are redirected to a throwaway temp directory
before anything that reads those env vars is imported, following
scripts/verify_eva_phase63_live_fixes.py's house skeleton.

        "change (the AttachThreadInput dance) and polls get_active_window() over a bounded settle window instead "
        "of reading it immediately, and ok now reflects the independently VERIFIED outcome, never the raw OS "
        "call's claim -- the exact CONFIRMED regression (ok=True, focused=False, verified=False while Notepad "
        "stayed foreground) now reports ok=False with error='focus_failed' and the real foreground window in the "
        "payload. (3) app_window_active gets a real independent postcondition check (reads the real foreground "
        "window itself, ignoring the tool's own self-report entirely); every other formerly-'observed' method now "
        "honestly reports unverified instead of a fabricated 'observed' provenance borrowed from the tool's "
        "self-reported ok, and ToolExecutor still never fabricates a demotion for a non-independent verification "
        "(only a genuine independent failure demotes -- both halves of that invariant are proven). (4) "
        "execute_all's per-step cap is named and configurable (max_tools_per_step/EVA_MAX_TOOLS_PER_STEP, default "
        "unchanged at 3), and truncation beyond it is now reported as an explicit result instead of silently "
        "dropped. Also: the previously-orphaned app.focus tool now has a real caller (the console "
        "'focus'/'focus window' command) while staying OUT of planner_specs(), and screen_submit_form attempts "
        "one focus restore before aborting on a staged-window mismatch -- proceeding if the restore fixes it, "
        "still aborting with nothing typed if it does not. Follow-up regression fix: giving app_window_active a "
        "real independent check initially broke the app-open tool (then app.open, since Phase 70 deleted as an "
        "unrouted duplicate of open_app), which also declared that method -- 'opened' is not 'focused' (another "
        "process holding the foreground lock is the ordinary case, not an edge case), so a perfectly successful "
        "launch was independently demoted to ok=False. Fixed by modelling, not by growing a tool-name heuristic "
        "further: open_app now declares app_window_open (a real independent check that a window exists, via the "
        "already-retrying verify_app_opened), app.focus keeps app_window_active (foreground IS its postcondition), "
        "and close_app declares command_result_success directly. verify_window_focused also gained the same "
        "retry/settle behaviour its siblings already had, so a focus landing a moment late is not a false failure "
        "either."
