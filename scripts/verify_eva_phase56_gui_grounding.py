"""Standalone verifier for Phase 56 (GUI grounding — the eyes).

For the whole project NOVA has been blind to GUIs: ``screen.observe`` grabbed a
screenshot but extracted nothing, ``ui_locator.locate_by_text_hint`` was a
``return None`` stub, and ``screen.click`` refuses raw coordinates and demands a
verified target nothing could produce — so "click Submit" / "fill the email
field" had no path. This is the missing bridge: a text label becomes a specific
on-screen target with coordinates and a confidence.

What this verifies (against fabricated accessibility trees — no real desktop):

  1. THE MATCHER PICKS THE RIGHT CONTROL: an exact label wins; a role word
     ("field") is stripped so "email field" matches a control named "Email".
  2. IT DECLINES RATHER THAN CLICKS THE WRONG THING: a wrong-role match falls
     below the click floor; off-screen/zero-size score zero; a disabled control
     is penalised, not chosen.
  3. IT IS OFF BY DEFAULT AND DEGRADES SAFELY: with the flag off, or the
     UIAutomation library absent, locate() returns None — byte-identical to the
     old stub, so nothing changes until the operator opts in.
  4. THE BRIDGE IS WIRED END TO END: screen.click(label="Submit") resolves a
     target through grounding, clears the confidence gate, and reaches the motor
     layer (which is itself gated behind EVA_ENABLE_REAL_INPUT); a no-match
     refuses; ui_locator.locate_by_text_hint now delegates to grounding.

Fully offline: injected trees, no network, no LLM, no real input.
