"""Standalone verifier for Phase 65: risk escalation must read TARGETS, not content.

Phase 55 escalates friction when a call's *arguments* reveal a risk the static
tool class cannot see -- the gate classifies per-TOOL and is blind to ARGS.
That is right, but ``_sensitive_targets`` implemented it by passing the ENTIRE
argument value to ``is_sensitive_target()`` whenever the value contained a path
separator anywhere. So prose tripped it. Measured before the fix:

    message.prepare(recipient='bob',
                    message='I saved it under C:/Windows/System32/drivers/etc/hosts')
        allow -> override

The heaviest friction tier -- requiring ``confirm override act_x`` -- for
*writing a sentence that mentions a path*. The marker list is ordinary English
and ordinary paths (``/windows``, ``system32``, ``program files``, ``/etc/``,
``credentials``, ``secrets``), so this was broad. It was also inconsistent:
``C:/Windows/System32/...`` in prose escalated while ``~/.ssh/id_rsa`` in prose
did not, because the whole sentence was tested rather than an extracted token.

The root cause is a category error, not a bad marker list. ``message`` /
``note`` / ``reason`` are CONTENT -- the tool never acts on them.
``message.prepare`` acts on ``recipient``; the body is payload.

The fix is ``ToolSpec.content_args``: argument names the tool's implementation
provably never dereferences, skipped by the sensitive-target scan.

THE RULE, which this verifier enforces:

    Declare an argument as content ONLY if the tool provably never
    dereferences it -- proven by READING THE IMPLEMENTATION, not by the
    argument's name.

That rule killed this phase's most attractive candidate. ``code_debug_traceback``
looks like pure free-form content; it is not. ``eva/code/debugger.py`` parses
file paths out of the traceback and READS them via ``safe_code_read()``. A test
below pins ``traceback`` as target-bearing so a future well-meaning change
cannot "finish the job" by declaring it.

Trust boundary: ``content_args`` LOWERS friction, inverting Phase 55's
only-ever-escalates invariant. It must therefore come from the ToolSpec in
source and never from caller input, or it is a self-authorization channel
exactly like the ``confirmed``/``_approved`` flags that are already stripped.

Also folded in (same family as Phase 64): ``message_prepare`` returned a
hardcoded ``"verification": {"verified": True, "confidence": 0.8}`` for merely
stashing a dict in memory. Nothing was verified.
