"""Standalone verifier for Phase 62 (encrypted vault + single gated form submission).

Phase 58 composed screen.click + screen.type_text into ``fill_form``, and every
test for it injected a fake executor that returned ``{"ok": True}`` for every
call. A fully green 90-verifier / 607-test suite shipped on top of that and
still hid two real defects, both invisible to a fake executor that was more
permissive than the real system:

  * **Defect A**: ``fill_form`` called ``registry.run("screen.type_text")`` per
    field. ``screen.type_text`` is confirm-class (it types on the user's real
    screen), so the REAL registry returned ``{"ok": False,
    "requires_confirmation": True}`` for the very first keystroke. ``fill_form``
    read that as a refusal and stopped at field 1. It could never fill a form
    for real -- only in a test that faked the gate away.
  * **Defect B**: the gate's ``_create_gated_pending`` wrote tool args straight
    into the on-disk pending-action ledger, so a real
    ``screen.type_text(text="hunter2")`` call persisted
    ``payload_summary: "text=hunter2"`` to disk in plaintext, waiting for
    anyone with filesystem access to read it back before it was ever approved.

Phase 62's fix is to gate the WHOLE form once instead of every keystroke: the
trusted console stages a form (``form_filler.stage_form``) -- literal values or
``@vault:name`` references into the new DPAPI-encrypted vault -- and gets back
an opaque ``spec_id``. The confirm-class tool ``screen.submit_form`` takes only
that id; a single approval lets ``screen_tools.screen_submit_form`` perform
every click/type/submit itself, calling the screen functions directly (already
past the gate) instead of re-entering ``ToolRegistry.run`` per field.

The governing rule for this file, learned from how both defects survived: a
test that fakes the gate away is not testing the gate. **Injection is allowed
BELOW the tool-level gate (the accessibility-tree provider that says what
controls exist, and the pyautogui actuator that would physically move the
mouse) but never ACROSS it.** Every property below drives the REAL
``ToolRegistry().run(...)`` and the REAL confirmation round-trip
(``handle_confirmation_command`` -> ``confirm_pending_action`` ->
``run_approved``), the same way ``backend/tests/test_form_submit_gate.py``
does.

What this verifies (all against the real registry/gate, fully offline):

  1. ``screen.submit_form`` classifies as confirm-class.
  2. Defect A pin: a bare ``screen.type_text`` call stalls asking for
     approval and types nothing -- documenting why per-keystroke gating of a
     multi-field form was dead on arrival.
  3. ONE approval fills every field (in order, with the right resolved
     values -- two vault refs and one literal) and fires the submit click,
     through the real confirmation round-trip.
  4. Defect B pin: after that real round-trip, the on-disk ledger's raw text
     contains no field value and no vault plaintext.
  5. The pending call's stored args are exactly ``{spec_id, reason}`` -- a
     reference, never a value, ever reaches the gate's persisted call record.
  6. A forged/never-staged ``spec_id`` is inert: it reports
     ``unknown_or_expired_form_spec`` and never touches the screen. This is
     the injection defense for a tool whose args are otherwise "just an id".
  7. Staged forms are single-use (a popped id cannot be replayed) and an aged
     entry is treated as expired.
  8. ``describe_staged_form`` -- the manifest a human approves -- shows vault
     NAMES and literal values in full, but never a vault VALUE.
  9. ``screen.submit_form`` is absent from ``planner_specs()`` and its name
     does not start with ``web.``/``mcp.`` (the two prefixes that
     auto-expose a tool to the planner) -- it is trusted-console-only.
  10. The vault's only plaintext egress is ``Vault.resolve()``; no
      show/dump/export/reveal-shaped method exists anywhere on it.
  11. Phase 51's audited gate-class counts (``EXPECTED_CLASS_COUNTS``) say
      ``confirm == 9`` (Phase 82 added ``close_app`` as confirm-class); this
      file imports that verifier's module and cross-checks the number so the
      two files cannot silently drift apart.
  12. Source property: ``stage_form`` -- the console-only entry point into
      staging -- is called from exactly one production module,
      ``backend/eva/core/fast_commands.py``. This cannot be checked by
      running code (nothing prevents a second caller from also behaving
      correctly at runtime), so it is checked by reading source.

Fully offline: no network, no LLM, no real mouse/keyboard movement, and the
vault + pending-action ledger are redirected to a throwaway temp directory
before anything that reads those paths is imported, so the real vault and the
real on-disk ledger are never touched.
