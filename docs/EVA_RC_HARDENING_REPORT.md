# Eva Release-Candidate Hardening Report

Phase 30 Release Candidate Hardening / Commit Planning is complete after this pass.

Phase 30 is report/status/planning only. The commit plan is text only.

## Findings

- Public docs describe deterministic reports and bounded previews, not unrestricted autonomy.
- Browser and desktop observation foundations do not claim control.
- CodingAgent remains unable to edit source, apply patches, or execute tools.
- Voice remains locked/mock; News remains local/mock or safe-read-only.
- Phase 12L remains the only real write path.
- Release-candidate surfaces contain no Git, publish, upload, package, provider, control, or tool executor.

## Warnings

- Ignored `.env` and `.env.local` filenames exist locally; their contents were not read.
- The Phase 30 working tree is intentionally uncommitted for user review.
- Fresh verifier evidence is required immediately before any later commit decision.

Blocking issues: none after the focused, quick, full, compile, and diff checks pass.

## Phase 30 boundary

For Phase 30, no git add/commit/tag/push was performed and no publishing/uploading was performed. No provider SDKs or package installs were added. No real LLM/API/provider calls happen.

No `.env`, `.env.local`, secrets, tokens, cookies, passwords, browser sessions, or config contents are read. Arbitrary file reads/writes are blocked. Browser/desktop/shell/cloud/MCP execution and tool execution remain locked.

CodingAgent remains preview/report/status only. News remains local/mock or safe-read-only. Voice remains a locked/mock foundation. Phase 12L narrow approved new `.md`/`.txt` creation remains the only real write path.

Next safe step: user-approved commit execution outside Eva or a separate explicit commit-approval phase.
