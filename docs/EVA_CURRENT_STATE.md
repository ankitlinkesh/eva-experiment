# Eva Current State

Last updated: 2026-07-04

This is a repo-local handoff for future Codex runs. Treat the working tree as active integration work: inspect files and tests before changing behavior, do not rebuild, and do not undo existing systems.

## Implemented Systems

- Agentic v2: `backend/eva/agent/runner.py`, `backend/eva/agent/planner.py`, `backend/eva/agent/policies.py`, `backend/eva/agent/state.py`, `backend/eva/agent/task.py`, verified by `scripts/verify_agentic_v2.py` and `scripts/verify_agent_runner.py`.
- Eva v2 Runtime Skeleton and explicit preview/execution path:
  - Phase 1: optional, disabled-by-default scaffolding in `backend/eva/runtime/`, specialist agents in `backend/eva/agents/`, typed schemas in `backend/eva/schemas/`, guardrail hooks in `backend/eva/guardrails/`, local traces in `backend/eva/observability/`, vector-memory interfaces in `backend/eva/vector_memory/`, optional adapters in `backend/eva/browser_automation/` and `backend/eva/desktop_automation/`, and promptfoo configs in `backend/eva/evals/promptfoo/`.
  - Phase 2: explicit dry-run/plan/route previews through `eva v2 dry run ...`, `eva v2 plan ...`, and `eva v2 route ...`.
  - Phase 2.5: catalog-only resource registry and MCP/open-source policy in `backend/eva/resources/`, documented in `docs/EVA_RESOURCE_REGISTRY.md` and `docs/EVA_MCP_POLICY.md`.
  - Phase 3: safe execution bridge in `backend/eva/runtime/execution_bridge.py` and policy in `backend/eva/runtime/execution_policy.py`.
  - Phase 3.1: resource/MCP wording and WhatsApp/message safety hardening.
  - Phase 4: read-only skill delegation in `backend/eva/runtime/read_only_delegates.py`.
  - Phase 5: pending action ledger and permission-session UX in `backend/eva/permissions/`.
  - Phase 6: Safe Code Index v2 in `backend/eva/code_index/`, with local metadata-only cache under `backend/eva/data/code_index/`.
- Laptop operator mode: deterministic command handling in `backend/eva/core/operator_commands.py` and `backend/eva/core/fast_commands.py`, with tools in `backend/eva/tools/registry.py`.
- Desktop Agent Core: desktop observation/window/action helpers in `backend/eva/desktop/` and desktop tools in `backend/eva/tools/desktop.py`, verified by `scripts/verify_desktop_agent_core.py`.
- Browser Agent Core: safe browser status, URL opening, page summaries, link extraction, and research save flow in `backend/eva/browser/`, verified by `scripts/verify_browser_agent_core.py`.
- Code Intelligence v1: safe code indexing/search/feature explanation in `backend/eva/code/`, verified by `scripts/verify_code_intelligence.py`.
- Safe Code Index v2: metadata-only local code scanner/search/symbol/file-summary package in `backend/eva/code_index/`, verified by `scripts/verify_eva_code_index_v2.py`. It skips secrets/runtime data and does not store full file contents.
- FileAgent v1 Read-Only Foundation, Phase 12B understanding, Phase 12C draft preview mode, Phase 12D apply-readiness planning, and Phase 12E approval ledger: repo-scoped safe file/folder metadata inspection, filename search, safe text preview, deterministic file summaries, project inventory, dependency/config hints, missing-file checklist, project structure summaries, output-only draft/diff previews, future-write safety plans, and future-apply approval metadata in `backend/eva/file_agent/` and `backend/eva/agents/file_agent.py`, documented in `docs/EVA_FILE_AGENT.md`, verified by `scripts/verify_eva_file_agent_readonly.py`, `scripts/verify_eva_file_agent_understanding.py`, `scripts/verify_eva_file_agent_draft_preview.py`, `scripts/verify_eva_file_agent_write_safety.py`, and `scripts/verify_eva_file_agent_approval_ledger.py`.
- Phase 12O Project Inspection + Reality Checker Workflow: read-only project/reality status modules in `backend/eva/skills/project_inspection.py` and `backend/eva/skills/reality_check.py`, routed through `eva ask` and explicit `eva project ...` commands. It uses FileAgent inventory, workflow state, Control Center, capabilities, and verifier-command surfaces. It does not run verifiers or execute tools. Verified by `scripts/verify_eva_project_reality_workflow.py`.
- Phase 12P Control Center v1 Upgrade: clearer local status/dashboard summaries in `backend/eva/control_center/`, with focused commands for enabled features, locked features, and next safe step. It is status-only, does not execute verifiers/tools, and keeps Phase 12L narrow real create as the only real write path. Verified by `scripts/verify_eva_control_center_v1.py`.
- Phase 12Q Global WorkSession + Audit Timeline: local session/audit tracking in `backend/eva/work_sessions/`, integrated with `eva ask`, Control Center, capabilities, planner, and team review. It records interpreted intent, selected specialists/skills/workflows, authority decision, workflow evidence, verification visibility, rollback visibility, final report, and next safe step. It is status/audit only and does not execute tools. Verified by `scripts/verify_eva_work_sessions_audit.py`.
- Phase 12S Hardening + Cleanup: read-only checkpoint readiness surfaces in `backend/eva/core/phase12_ready.py`, routed through `eva phase 12 ...` commands and `eva ask`. It summarizes Phase 12 readiness, limits, and proof commands without running verifiers or enabling execution. Verified by `scripts/verify_eva_phase12_ready.py`.
- Workspace Skills: safe workspace list/read/search/summary tools in `backend/eva/workspace/`, verified by `scripts/verify_workspace_skills.py`.
- NVIDIA NIM provider: OpenAI-compatible provider in `backend/eva/llm/providers/nvidia_nim.py` with router integration in `backend/eva/llm/router.py`, verified by `scripts/verify_nvidia_nim_provider.py`.
- Research Knowledge SQLite: local research topic/source/note storage in `backend/eva/research/`, defaulting under `backend/eva/data/`, verified by `scripts/verify_research_knowledge.py`.
- Self-diagnostics and provider diagnostics: capability routing in `backend/eva/core/intent_router.py`, diagnostics in `backend/eva/diagnostics/`, and health/provider formatting in `backend/eva/api/routes.py`, verified by `scripts/verify_self_diagnostics.py` and `scripts/verify_capability_routing.py`.
- Tavily web search: search/fallback logic in `backend/eva/tools/tavily_search.py`, verified by `scripts/verify_tavily_search.py`.
- Screen vision: one-shot explicit screenshot analysis in `backend/eva/vision/` and screen tools in `backend/eva/tools/registry.py`, verified by `scripts/verify_screen_vision.py`.
- Memory SQLite: conversation/event/fact storage in `backend/eva/memory/store.py`; runtime database files are ignored.
- Push-to-talk/browser voice UI: frontend voice controls in `frontend/` and Piper status/synthesis in `backend/eva/voice/piper.py`, verified by `scripts/verify_voice_ui.py`.
- Ollama fallback and provider fallback/rate-limit handling: model/provider routers in `backend/eva/models/` and `backend/eva/llm/`, verified by `scripts/verify_llm_router.py` and `scripts/verify_rate_limits.py`.

## Safety Rules

- Do not commit until the user explicitly asks.
- Do not hardcode, print, summarize, or expose API keys or secrets.
- Secrets stay in `.env.local`; do not read or print `.env.local`.
- `.env.local`, `.env`, `*.env`, local SQLite databases, logs, `.venv/`, and `backend/eva/data/` are ignored by `.gitignore`.
- Runtime/generated folders are ignored: `backend/eva/data/`, `backend/data/checkpoints/`, `data/`, `bin/`, `models/`, `frontend/assets/`, logs, screenshots, caches, SQLite DBs, `.venv/`, and `node_modules/`.
- Do not add arbitrary shell execution.
- No camera support.
- No always-on screen watching. Screen capture and vision must stay one-shot and explicit.
- Power actions require explicit confirmation.
- MCP execution remains disabled.
- Playwright execution remains disabled.
- PyAutoGUI execution remains disabled.
- WhatsApp automatic sending remains disabled; message requests create pending confirmation records only.
- File write/edit/delete execution remains disabled in v2; destructive requests create pending override records only.
- FileAgent is read-only plus preview-only drafts/apply-readiness, approval metadata, sandbox apply, and the Phase 12L create-new-text-file gate. All existing-file edits, overwrites, appends, deletes, moves, renames, copies, source/config/runtime writes, broad backups/restores, whole-drive scans, secret reads, runtime database previews, OCR, PDF parsing, DOCX parsing, cloud/LLM summaries, automatic indexing, broad draft apply, and planner task execution remain blocked.
- Project inspection and reality-check commands are read-only evidence formatters. They must not claim completion without fresh verifier output and must not run verifier commands from chat.
- Control Center commands are read-only status formatters. They may show locked features, enabled features, workflow state, and verifier commands, but they must not run subprocesses, open browsers, control desktop apps, call cloud services, or enable locked features.
- WorkSession commands are local audit/status formatters. They may record and display `eva ask` routing evidence, but they must not execute verifiers, browser/desktop control, shell commands, MCP, package installs, cloud calls, message sends, or broader file actions.
- Confirmed risky pending actions still do not execute until a future verified executor phase exists.
- Do not route every issue through fast commands. Prefer capability routing, skill routing, planner/tool integration, and grounded system awareness. Use fast commands only for deterministic controls, safety-critical actions, and lightweight local shortcuts.

## How To Run Eva

From the repo root:

```powershell
cd <repo-root>
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m uvicorn backend.eva.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8765
```

Or run:

```powershell
.\run.ps1
```

Open locally at:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8765
```

Open from a phone on the same trusted Wi-Fi at:

```text
http://<laptop-ip>:8765
```

Stop the usual server process with:

```powershell
.\stop.ps1
```

## Key Verification Scripts

Use compile checks plus focused verifiers. The most common baseline is:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m compileall backend
```

Important focused scripts:

- `scripts/verify_eva_project_reality_workflow.py`
- `scripts/verify_eva_control_center_v1.py`
- `scripts/verify_eva_code_index_v2.py`
- `scripts/verify_eva_file_agent_readonly.py`
- `scripts/verify_eva_file_agent_understanding.py`
- `scripts/verify_eva_file_agent_draft_preview.py`
- `scripts/verify_eva_file_agent_write_safety.py`

- `scripts/verify_screen_vision.py`
- `scripts/verify_voice_ui.py`
- `scripts/verify_tavily_search.py`

## Current Request Flow

`backend/eva/api/routes.py` currently routes chat through these layers:

1. Lightweight deterministic fast commands/responses.
2. Operator commands for safe desktop/browser/system controls.
3. Capability routing through `backend/eva/core/intent_router.py`.
4. Agentic runner for multi-step agentic intents.
5. Planner/tool execution through `ToolCallPlanner`, `ToolExecutor`, and `ToolRegistry`.
6. LLM fallback through cloud/provider router and local Ollama fallback.

Eva v2 runtime is installed around this flow but is not the default path. `EVA_V2_RUNTIME_ENABLED=false` keeps current Eva behavior active; v2 commands are explicit through `backend/eva/core/fast_commands.py`.

## Current v2 Status

Explicit v2 commands work:

- `eva v2 status`
- `eva runtime status`
- `agents status`
- `guardrails status`
- `vector memory status`
- `traces status`
- `automation adapters status`
- `resources status`
- `mcp status`
- `open source tools status`
- `resource detail <id>`
- `eva v2 route <request>`
- `eva v2 plan <request>`
- `eva v2 dry run <request>`
- `eva v2 execute <request>`

Current v2 execution boundary:

- Can execute low-risk status commands.
- Can open public browser apps through existing Chrome Execution Skills where already allowlisted.
- Can delegate read-only code, research, and memory requests through existing safe helpers.
- Can create pending actions for risky requests such as WhatsApp sends, destructive file requests, and visible desktop control.
- Cannot execute confirmed risky pending actions yet.
- Cannot execute MCP, Playwright, PyAutoGUI, arbitrary shell, WhatsApp send, file write/edit/delete, post/submit/purchase, or destructive/system-changing actions.
- FileAgent Phase 12F can test approved file-change metadata only in an ignored runtime sandbox with sandbox-only backup, verification, and rollback. It cannot apply approved records to real project/user files.
- Phase 12G adds a deterministic natural-language `eva ask <request>` wrapper and a global `AuthorityDecision` summary spine. It routes obvious natural requests to existing safe commands and still blocks real file writes, browser/desktop control, terminal execution, MCP, cloud calls, and normal-chat v2 routing.
- Phase 12H adds Eva Control Center v1, a read-only local dashboard and status collector at `/control` with safe JSON at `/control/status.json`. It shows authority, natural router, FileAgent, approvals, sandbox apply, capabilities, agents, planner, verifiers, safety boundaries, and future locked modules.
- Phase 12L adds FileAgent's narrow real apply gate: a confirmed approval can create one new `.md` or `.txt` file directly under `docs/` or `samples/` only. Existing files cannot be edited or overwritten. Source, config, runtime, database, binary, image, PDF, DOCX, XLSX, delete, move, rename, and broad apply remain blocked.
- Phase 12J adds Golden Workflow Polish: `eva ask` can start the safe project-note workflow that connects deterministic draft preview, FileAgent approval metadata, sandbox apply/verify/rollback, narrow real-create eligibility, exact confirmation, real-create verification, Control Center status, and exact rollback guidance. It does not enable broad writes.
- Phase 12K adds smoke/profile verification UX: `scripts/verify_eva_smoke.py`, `scripts/verify_eva_phase12_stabilization.py`, `scripts/verify_eva_all.py --quick`, `scripts/verify_eva_all.py --full`, read-only verification status commands, and a Control Center Phase 12 Health section. These surfaces show status and manual commands only; chat does not run shell commands.
- Phase 12M adds Specialist Role + Skill Workflow Foundation: `backend/eva/specialists/` and `backend/eva/skills/` provide deterministic specialist, skill, and workflow selection. `eva ask` can show specialist/skill/workflow routes and the FileAgent project-note workflow plan. This is metadata and next-step guidance only; no workflow action is executed by the 12M layer.
- Phase 12N adds Golden Workflow UX Polish + Latest-State Handling: `backend/eva/skills/workflow_state.py` summarizes latest FileAgent approval/apply/rollback context, disambiguates multiple candidates, and powers `eva workflow state`, `eva workflow next`, latest workflow debug commands, Control Center workflow panels, and smoother `eva ask` next-step responses.
- Phase 12Q adds Global WorkSession + Audit Timeline: `backend/eva/work_sessions/` stores local, sanitized WorkSession records and timeline events for `eva ask` requests. It adds `eva sessions status`, `eva sessions recent`, `eva session latest`, `eva session <session_id>`, `eva session timeline <session_id>`, `eva audit timeline`, and `eva work status`. It is audit/status only and does not enable new execution.
- Phase 12R adds End-to-End Golden Workflow Test proof: `scripts/verify_eva_golden_workflow_e2e.py`, `eva workflow golden test plan`, `eva workflow golden latest`, and `eva workflow golden proof` verify and expose the natural FileAgent project-note path from `eva ask` through approval, sandbox, exact 12L real create, verification, WorkSession timeline, Control Center status, and guarded rollback. It does not add broad execution.
- Phase 12S adds final readiness/status cleanup: `eva phase 12 ready`, `eva phase 12 summary`, `eva phase 12 limits`, `eva phase 12 proof`, plus natural `eva ask` routes for the same questions. These commands are read-only status/proof surfaces; they show manual verifier commands and keep Phase 12L as the only real write path.
- Safe Code Index v2 is local and metadata-only; cache files live under `backend/eva/data/code_index/`.
- Runtime caches, traces, pending action ledgers, SQLite stores, and generated data live under ignored runtime folders such as `backend/eva/data/`.

## Eva Control Center v1

Phase 12H provides a local UI/status surface only.

Routes:

- `http://127.0.0.1:8765/control`
- `http://127.0.0.1:8765/control/status.json`

Commands:

- `eva control center status`
- `eva dashboard status`
- `eva dashboard url`
- `eva ask show control center`
- `eva ask open dashboard`

The dashboard does not open a browser automatically, execute tools, read secrets, enable browser/desktop control, call cloud services, or write real files. BrowserAgent, News Dashboard, CodingAgent, ScreenAgent, Voice control, and Terminal execution are visible as locked/disabled future modules.

## Phase 12L Narrow Real Apply

Debug/fallback commands:

- `eva file real apply policy`
- `eva file real apply eligibility <approval_id>`
- `eva file approval real create <approval_id> confirm real create <approval_id>`
- `eva file approval real verify <approval_id>`
- `eva file approval real rollback <approval_id> confirm rollback real create <approval_id>`
- `eva file real apply status`

The real-create gate requires an existing approved FileAgent approval record and exact confirmation. Verification reads back the created file and compares a hash. Rollback is available only for an unchanged file Eva created through this gate. No nested folders, `notes/`, source files, config files, runtime data, or existing-file changes are allowed.

## Phase 12J Golden Workflows

Main workflow: `safe_project_note_create`.

Natural-language-first examples:

- `eva ask create a project note about Eva`
- `eva ask make a safe markdown note about FileAgent`
- `eva ask draft and safely create a note about this project`
- `eva ask show golden workflow status`

Debug/fallback commands:

- `eva golden workflows`
- `eva golden workflow status`
- `eva workflow golden status`
- `eva workflow golden test plan`
- `eva workflow golden latest`
- `eva workflow golden proof`
- `eva golden workflow start project note`
- `eva golden workflow demo`
- `eva golden workflow help`

The workflow creates approval metadata first. Real create still requires an approved FileAgent record, sandbox testing, eligibility review, and the exact phrase `confirm real create <approval_id>`. Rollback still requires `confirm rollback real create <approval_id>`.

Broad writes remain disabled: no existing-file edits, no overwrite, no source/config/runtime writes, no browser/desktop control, no MCP, no package installs, no cloud calls, and no paid tools.

## Phase 12Q WorkSession Audit Timeline

Commands:

- `eva sessions status`
- `eva sessions recent`
- `eva session latest`
- `eva session <session_id>`
- `eva session timeline <session_id>`
- `eva audit timeline`
- `eva work status`
- `eva ask what happened last`

Each `eva ask` response records a sanitized local WorkSession with route evidence, selected specialist/skill/workflow metadata, authority mode, visible FileAgent workflow evidence, final report, and next safe step. Runtime session data lives under ignored `backend/eva/data/`. This layer is not an executor and does not run verifiers, tools, browser/desktop control, shell commands, MCP, package installs, cloud calls, or broader file writes.

## Phase 12K Verification UX

Phase 12K adds a fast smoke gate and clearer verifier entrypoints.

Commands:

- `eva smoke status`
- `eva verify quick command`
- `eva verify full command`
- `eva phase 12 status`
- `eva phase 12 ready`
- `eva phase 12 summary`
- `eva phase 12 limits`
- `eva phase 12 proof`
- `eva ux status`
- `eva ask run quick check`
- `eva ask how do I verify Eva`
- `eva ask show phase 12 status`
- `eva ask is Eva safe right now`

Verifier scripts:

- `scripts/verify_eva_smoke.py`
- `scripts/verify_eva_phase12_stabilization.py`
- `scripts/verify_eva_phase12_ready.py`
- `scripts/verify_eva_all.py --quick`
- `scripts/verify_eva_all.py --full`

The quick profile runs only the smoke, golden workflow, and Control Center verifiers. The full profile runs the broader Phase 12/FileAgent/planner sweep. `eva ask` and Control Center may show these commands, but they do not execute subprocesses from chat or the dashboard.

## Phase 12M Specialist And Skill Workflows

Commands:

- `eva specialists status`
- `eva specialists list`
- `eva specialist <id>`
- `eva skills status`
- `eva skills list`
- `eva skill <id>`
- `eva workflows status`
- `eva workflows list`
- `eva workflow <id>`

Registered specialists include FileAgent workflow, codebase onboarding, technical writer, reality checker, evidence collector, test results analyzer, and safety reviewer. Registered skills include project-note workflow, safe draft, read-only project inspection, verification-before-completion, and safety status review.

The main workflow is `fileagent_project_note_create`. It explains the draft, approval, sandbox, Phase 12L narrow real-create, verification, and rollback sequence without executing the workflow. `scripts/verify_eva_skill_specialist_workflows.py` covers the 12M foundation.

## Phase 12N Latest-State Workflow UX

Commands:

- `eva workflow state`
- `eva workflow next`
- `eva workflow latest approval`
- `eva workflow latest sandbox`
- `eva workflow latest real create`
- `eva workflow latest rollback`
- `eva file latest status`
- `eva file latest real create`
- `eva file latest rollback`

Natural requests can now ask Eva to continue the project-note workflow, show the latest real-create verification target, show rollback availability, or ask what to do next. Eva does not guess across multiple candidates. It lists safe approval IDs and asks the user to specify one. Exact confirmation remains required for real create and rollback.

## Phase 13A BrowserAgent Safety Model

Phase 13A adds a BrowserAgent safety foundation only. It provides local status, policy, readiness, blocked-action, domain-policy, and action-safety preview commands:

- `eva browser status`
- `eva browser policy`
- `eva browser blocked actions`
- `eva browser domain policy`
- `eva browser action safety <action>`
- `eva browser readiness`

`eva ask` can answer browser safety questions such as whether Eva can use the browser, what browser actions are allowed, whether browser control is enabled, and whether Eva can click, type, log in, upload, download, or submit forms. The answer is status/policy only.

Real browser control remains locked. Phase 13A does not launch browsers, navigate real pages, click, type, submit forms, automate login/payment/upload/download, read cookies, read localStorage, read browser profiles, take screenshots, watch the screen, enable Playwright/browser-use/Stagehand/Maxun, enable MCP, enable PyAutoGUI, run shell commands, install packages, or call cloud services.

## Phase 13B Browser Session Preview

Phase 13B adds preview-only BrowserAgent session records and status surfaces. It does not create a real browser session.

Commands:

- `eva browser session status`
- `eva browser sessions`
- `eva browser session preview`
- `eva browser session latest`
- `eva browser session plan`
- `eva browser readiness`

`eva ask` can answer browser-session prompts such as starting a browser session, opening a browser, whether Eva can browse websites, session status, future session behavior, and read-only-mode readiness. All responses are preview/status only and say real browser control is locked.

Control Center includes a Browser Session Preview panel with latest preview session, allowed preview actions, blocked real actions, domain policy summary, next browser phase, and readiness gaps. No browser launch, navigation, screenshot, DOM read, click/type/form/upload/download/login/payment automation, cookie/localStorage/profile/session/password read, Playwright/browser-use/Stagehand/Maxun execution, MCP, PyAutoGUI, desktop control, shell/package/cloud call, or normal-chat browser execution is enabled.

## Phase 13C Browser Page/Text/DOM Summary Design

Phase 13C adds BrowserAgent page/text/DOM summary schema design only. It can show observation policy, redaction policy, DOM/text extraction policy, readiness, and a mock-text page summary preview. It does not read live browser pages.

Commands:

- `eva browser page summary policy`
- `eva browser page summary preview`
- `eva browser dom summary policy`
- `eva browser text extraction policy`
- `eva browser observation readiness`
- `eva browser redaction policy`

`eva ask` can answer whether Eva can read or summarize webpages, inspect DOM, take screenshots, show observation policy, or explain future webpage extraction. All responses are preview/status only and say live browser observation is locked.

Control Center includes a Browser Observation Preview panel with page/text/DOM summary design status, live-read lock status, screenshot lock status, redaction policy, future read-only requirements, and next browser phase. No live page read, DOM access, screenshot/screen capture, browser launch/navigation, click/type/form/upload/download/login/payment automation, cookie/localStorage/profile/session/password read, Playwright/browser-use/Stagehand/Maxun execution, MCP, PyAutoGUI, desktop control, shell/package/cloud call, or normal-chat browser execution is enabled.

## Phase 13D Browser Action Dry-Run Schema

Phase 13D adds BrowserAgent action dry-run planning only. It can turn a browser request into text-only preview steps, risk levels, approval requirements, blocked-execution explanations, and readiness gaps. It does not execute browser actions.

Commands:

- `eva browser action dry run <request>`
- `eva browser action plan <request>`
- `eva browser action risk <action>`
- `eva browser action approvals`
- `eva browser dry run policy`
- `eva browser action readiness`

`eva ask` can dry-run opening a website, explain what Eva would do to search Google, classify click/type/login plans, show approval requirements, or show the dry-run policy. All responses are dry-run/status only and say real browser execution is locked.

Control Center includes a Browser Action Dry-Run panel with status, allowed dry-run behavior, blocked execution, risk levels, approval requirements, and next phase. No browser launch, navigation, screenshot/screen capture, DOM/live page read, click/type/form/upload/download/login/payment execution, cookie/localStorage/profile/session/password read, Playwright/browser-use/Stagehand/Maxun execution, MCP, PyAutoGUI, desktop control, shell/package/cloud call, or normal-chat browser execution is enabled.

## Phase 13E Browser Domain Policy + Site Risk Model

Phase 13E adds string-only BrowserAgent domain and site-risk classification. It can classify a provided domain or URL string, show domain rules, list sensitive site categories, explain future approval requirements, and show domain-readiness gaps. It does not perform DNS, network calls, browser launch, navigation, live page fetch/read, screenshot capture, DOM access, cookie/localStorage/profile/session/password/token reads, click/type/submit/login/payment/upload/download, Playwright/browser-use/Stagehand/Maxun execution, MCP, PyAutoGUI, desktop control, shell/package/cloud calls, or normal-chat browser execution.

Commands:

- `eva browser domain check <domain-or-url>`
- `eva browser site risk <domain-or-url>`
- `eva browser domain rules`
- `eva browser sensitive sites`
- `eva browser domain approvals`
- `eva browser domain readiness`

`eva ask` can answer whether a site is safe for Eva, whether Eva can use Gmail or a banking site, whether uploads are allowed, what sites are risky, what domain policy says, and what approvals would be needed for sensitive sites. All responses are policy/status only and say real browser access is locked.

Control Center includes a Browser Domain Risk panel with site-risk model status, sensitive categories, blocked categories, future approval requirements, and next browser phase. Phase 12L narrow real create remains the only real write path.

## Phase 13F Browser Read-Only Readiness Proof

Phase 13F adds a BrowserAgent read-only readiness proof layer. It consolidates proof that the safety model, preview sessions, observation/page-summary design, action dry-run, and domain/site-risk model exist, while proving live browser read-only mode is still not enabled.

Commands:

- `eva browser read only readiness`
- `eva browser readiness proof`
- `eva browser safety proof`
- `eva browser readiness gaps`
- `eva browser locked status`
- `eva browser phase 13 proof`

`eva ask` can answer whether browser read-only mode is ready, prove browser control is still locked, show what is missing before browser read-only mode, show browser safety proof, say whether Phase 13 browser work is safe, and answer whether Eva can browse now. All responses are proof/status only.

Control Center includes a Browser Read-Only Readiness Proof panel with readiness status, completed safety layers, readiness gaps, locked execution summary, next browser phase, and proof status. No browser launch, navigation, DNS/network calls, live website fetch/read, screenshots, DOM access, cookies/localStorage/session/profile/password reads, click/type/submit/login/payment/upload/download, Playwright/browser-use/Stagehand/Maxun execution, shell/package/cloud/MCP/PyAutoGUI/desktop calls, or normal-chat browser execution is enabled.

## Phase 13G BrowserAgent Hardening

Phase 13G closes BrowserAgent Phase 13 as a safety/readiness foundation. It adds final proof/status commands that align BrowserAgent command output, Control Center wording, planner/team-review metadata, capability metadata, and docs. It does not enable real browser read-only mode or browser control.

Commands:

- `eva browser phase 13 status`
- `eva browser phase 13 summary`
- `eva browser phase 13 limits`
- `eva browser phase 13 ready`
- `eva browser phase 13 final proof`

`eva ask` can answer whether BrowserAgent Phase 13 is complete, summarize BrowserAgent Phase 13, show Phase 13 limits, and answer whether Eva can browse now. Every response states that Phase 13 is safety/readiness only; real browser read-only mode is not enabled; real browser control is not enabled; network/DNS/live page read/DOM/screenshot/action execution are locked; any future real browser read-only mode requires a separate approved gate; and Phase 12L narrow real create remains the only real write path.

## Phase 14A-14B DesktopAgent Safety + Session Preview

Phase 14A adds a DesktopAgent safety foundation only. Phase 14B adds app/window/session status previews without enabling real observation or control. It provides local status, policy, blocked-action, action-safety, app-risk, session-preview, app/window/active-context schema-preview, and readiness commands:

- `eva desktop status`
- `eva desktop policy`
- `eva desktop blocked actions`
- `eva desktop action safety <action>`
- `eva desktop app risk <app-or-category>`
- `eva desktop readiness`
- `eva desktop session status`
- `eva desktop sessions`
- `eva desktop session preview`
- `eva desktop session latest`
- `eva desktop session plan`
- `eva desktop app status preview`
- `eva desktop window status preview`
- `eva desktop active context preview`
- `eva desktop observation readiness`

`eva ask` can answer whether Eva can control the desktop, see the screen, click/type, open apps, use terminal, show desktop policy, list allowed desktop actions, start a desktop session preview, show desktop session status, preview open-window/active-app schemas, describe what desktop observation would include, or report whether desktop observation/control is enabled. All responses are safety/status/preview only.

Real desktop observation/control remains locked. Phase 14B does not capture the screen, take screenshots, enumerate windows, inspect apps, detect active apps/windows, launch apps, move/click/drag the mouse, type, use hotkeys, access clipboard, automate file dialogs, run terminal/shell commands, install packages, send messages, read secrets/private desktop state, enable PyAutoGUI/Playwright/MCP, call cloud services, or route normal chat through desktop execution. Phase 12L narrow real create remains the only real write path.

## Phase 14C Desktop Screen Observation Policy

Phase 14C adds screen observation policy/status only. It provides:

- `eva desktop screen policy`
- `eva desktop screen observation policy`
- `eva desktop sensitive screens`
- `eva desktop screen redaction policy`
- `eva desktop screen capture gate`
- `eva desktop screen readiness`
- `eva desktop observation policy`

`eva ask` can answer whether Eva can see/read the screen, take screenshots, which screens are sensitive, what would be redacted, and whether screen observation is ready. All responses are policy/status only. Real screen observation remains locked: no screen capture, screenshots, OCR, image analysis, real window/app inspection, active app detection, desktop control, PyAutoGUI/Playwright/MCP, shell/package, browser/network, or cloud calls are enabled.

## Phase 14D Desktop Action Dry-Run

Phase 14D adds Desktop Action Dry-Run schema/status only. Eva can turn desktop action requests into text-only preview steps, risk levels, future approval requirements, blocked-execution explanations, and readiness gaps.

Commands:

- `eva desktop action dry run <request>`
- `eva desktop action plan <request>`
- `eva desktop action risk <action>`
- `eva desktop action approvals`
- `eva desktop dry run policy`
- `eva desktop action readiness`

`eva ask` can answer dry-run clicking/typing/hotkey/app-open/message-action planning questions and explain what desktop actions would need approval. All responses are dry-run/status only. Real desktop control remains locked: no mouse movement/click/drag, keyboard typing/hotkeys, clipboard access, app launch/focus, file dialog automation, screen capture, screenshots, terminal/package execution, PyAutoGUI/Playwright/MCP, browser/network, cloud calls, or normal-chat desktop execution is enabled.

## Phase 14E Desktop Action Risk Scoring

Phase 14E adds Desktop Action Risk Scoring as risk/status only. Eva can score action/app/context strings, explain risk factors, explain future approval requirements, show a safety matrix, list high-risk desktop actions, and report readiness gaps.

Commands:

- `eva desktop risk score <request>`
- `eva desktop risk factors <request>`
- `eva desktop approval required <request>`
- `eva desktop safety matrix`
- `eva desktop high risk actions`
- `eva desktop risk readiness`

`eva ask` can answer how risky clicking/typing/uploading/opening terminal would be, what approval a message send would need, which desktop actions are high risk, and show the desktop safety matrix. All responses are risk/status only. Real desktop observation/control remains locked, and no browser/network execution is enabled.

## Phase 14F Desktop Human Approval Model

Phase 14F adds the Desktop Human Approval Model as policy/status only. Eva can preview future approval levels, confirmation phrase classes, forbidden desktop action classes, and audit-schema readiness without unlocking desktop actions.

Commands:

- `eva desktop approval policy`
- `eva desktop approval levels`
- `eva desktop approval preview <request>`
- `eva desktop confirmation phrase <request>`
- `eva desktop forbidden actions`
- `eva desktop approval audit status`
- `eva desktop approval readiness`

`eva ask` can answer whether Eva can be approved to control the desktop, what approval would be needed to click/type, what confirmation phrase would be required, which desktop actions are forbidden, and whether desktop approval is ready. Approvals and confirmation phrases do not unlock real desktop execution. No screen observation, app/window inspection, app launch, mouse/keyboard/clipboard/file-dialog action, terminal/package execution, PyAutoGUI/Playwright/MCP, browser/network/cloud call, or normal-chat desktop execution is enabled.

## Phase 14G DesktopAgent Locked Readiness Proof

Phase 14G completes the DesktopAgent foundation as a proof/status layer. It confirms that safety, session previews, screen policy, action dry-run planning, risk scoring, and human approval previews exist while real desktop observation and control remain locked. Approval previews and confirmation phrases do not unlock execution.

Commands: `eva desktop phase 14 status`, `eva desktop phase 14 summary`, `eva desktop phase 14 limits`, `eva desktop phase 14 ready`, `eva desktop phase 14 final proof`, `eva desktop readiness proof`, `eva desktop locked status`, and `eva desktop readiness gaps`.
