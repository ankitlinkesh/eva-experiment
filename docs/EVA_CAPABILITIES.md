# Eva Capabilities

Eva capabilities are local metadata records that describe what an existing Eva system can do, how risky it is, and which verifier covers it. They are discovery and planning inputs, not a broad execution switch.

## Capability Model

Each capability records:

- id and name
- provider and category
- risk level
- read-only or local-write mode
- confirmation requirement
- default enabled status
- safety notes
- verifier name when available

The safe catalog currently covers existing Research Memory, FileAgent read-only repo inspection, heuristic project understanding, output-only draft previews, apply-readiness planning, approval-ledger metadata, sandbox-only apply harness metadata, explicit Eva v2 preview/status paths, and public release/demo/status surfaces.

Phase 12O adds read-only project/reality capabilities:

- `eva.project_inspect`
- `eva.project_reality_check`
- `eva.project_recent_changes`
- `eva.project_next_step`
- `eva.project_proof`
- `eva.done_check`

They are metadata/status formatters only. They do not run verifiers or enable file, browser, desktop, MCP, terminal, package, cloud, or message execution.

Phase 12P upgrades Control Center status capabilities:

- `eva.control_center_status`
- `eva.control_center_summary`
- `eva.locked_features`
- `eva.enabled_features`
- `eva.next_safe_step`

These are read-only dashboard/status views. They make locked features visible instead of hidden, but they do not unlock them.

Phase 12Q adds WorkSession/audit capabilities:

- `eva.work_sessions_status`
- `eva.work_sessions_recent`
- `eva.work_session_timeline`
- `eva.audit_timeline`
- `eva.latest_work_session`

These are local audit/status views. They display sanitized WorkSession records for routed `eva ask` requests and do not execute tools, verifiers, browser/desktop control, shell commands, MCP, package installs, cloud calls, message sends, or broad file actions.

Phase 12S adds read-only readiness/proof capabilities:

- `eva.phase12_ready`
- `eva.phase12_summary`
- `eva.phase12_limits`
- `eva.phase12_proof`

These show checkpoint readiness, limits, and proof commands. They do not run verifier subprocesses or enable any new execution path.

## Permissions

The permission matrix explains whether a capability is read-only, an explicit local write, confirmation-gated, or blocked by default. External sending, browser control, desktop control, MCP execution, Playwright, PyAutoGUI, arbitrary shell, and destructive file actions remain disabled or future-gated.

Commands:

- `eva capability permissions`
- `eva capability permission <capability_id>`

## Resource Mapping

Phase 9D adds a metadata-only bridge:

Capability -> Permission decision -> Resource -> Provider or agent -> Tool schema preview -> Execution availability -> Safety notes

This helps future Planner v3 answer:

- which capability fits a goal
- which resource backs it
- whether it is allowed
- whether it is available now, preview-only, disabled experimental, or reference-only
- which agent would handle it later

Commands:

- `eva capability resolve <capability_id>`
- `eva capability resources <capability_id>`
- `eva resource capabilities <resource_id>`
- `eva capability resource matrix`
- `eva capabilities available`
- `eva capabilities preview only`
- `eva capabilities blocked`
- `eva capability plan resources <goal text>`

## Tool Schema Previews

Tool schema previews describe parameters and execution class for safe existing capabilities. They do not execute tools.

Commands:

- `eva capability schema <capability_id>`
- `eva tool schema preview <capability_id>`
- `eva tool schemas`

## Public vs Private Mode

Public/community mode keeps high-risk systems disabled. Private/local development may expose more metadata, but Phase 9D does not enable risky execution in either mode.

Current non-enabled surfaces:

- MCP execution
- Playwright execution
- PyAutoGUI execution
- browser control
- screen watching
- WhatsApp sending
- arbitrary shell
- cloud embeddings
- default vector search
- normal-chat routing through Eva v2

## Examples

`eva capability resolve research_memory.retrieve` shows the Research Memory resource, permission status, ResearchAgent ownership, schema-preview availability, and `available_read_only` status.

`eva capability resolve research_memory.vector_search` shows that the vector index resource is experimental and disabled by default. Lexical Research Memory retrieval remains primary.

They are mock/dry-run metadata only: live LLM/API/network calls, provider SDK use, secret/config reads, and tool execution remain locked.

Phase 15B fallback, degraded-mode, limits, runaway-protection, failure-mode, and routing-audit surfaces are deterministic mock/dry-run only. They simulate policies without provider SDKs, `.env`/secret/config reads, live calls, or LLM-output tool execution. Browser/desktop execution remains locked; Phase 12L narrow real create remains the only real write path. Next: Phase 15C Structured Output Validation Hardening.

## Phase 15C Structured Output Validation Hardening

Phase 15C is complete as a mock/local-only validation surface. The read-only capabilities are `llm.validation_status`, `llm.schema_registry`, `llm.validation_policy`, `llm.repair_policy`, `llm.validate_mock`, `llm.validate_invalid_examples`, and `llm.validation_readiness`. They expose status, policy, and refusal-preview evidence only: live LLM/API calls remain locked, provider SDKs and secret/config/session reads are not used, invalid LLM output cannot execute tools, repair does not execute or rewrite user intent, and hallucinated, secret-like, or private-path-like output is rejected. Browser/desktop execution remains locked; Phase 12L narrow approved new `.md`/`.txt` creation remains the only real write path. Next: Phase 15D LLM Router Red-Team/Failure Tests.

They use no live LLM/API/provider call or SDK; read no `.env`, `.env.local`, secrets, tokens, cookies, passwords, browser sessions, or config secrets; and keep tool, browser, desktop, shell, cloud, and MCP execution locked. Unsafe LLM-like output—including prompt injection, hallucinated capabilities, secret exfiltration, oversized output, malformed JSON, and command-injection-looking text—fails safely. Phase 12L narrow approved new `.md`/`.txt` creation remains the only real write path. Next: Phase 16 Context Assembly Engine.

Phase 15E adds a deterministic local/mock evidence lock over that catalog. It records expected safe classifications and fails verification on omissions, unknown/duplicate IDs, unsafe allows, or outcome mismatches; it does not add provider integration, execution, or writes.

Source freshness, reliability, uncertainty, and citation metadata are tracked; Phase 24 public URL read-only policy is respected. No provider SDKs, package installs, real LLM/API/provider calls, secret/config/session reads, arbitrary file reads/writes, tool execution, or browser/desktop/shell/cloud/MCP execution was added. Phase 12L narrow approved new `.md`/`.txt` creation remains the only real file write path. Next phase is Phase 28 Coding Specialist / CodingAgent.

## Phase 28 Coding Specialist / CodingAgent Foundation

Phase 28 Coding Specialist / CodingAgent Foundation is complete after this pass. It adds twelve read/status capabilities under `coding.*` for status, policy, specialist catalog, task classification, safe project context, patch-plan preview, review checklist, test-plan preview, risk review, handoff, blocked actions, and readiness. Every capability is deterministic local preview/report/status only.

No source edit, patch application, arbitrary code execution, shell/test/package/git operation, arbitrary filesystem read/write, tool execution, provider SDK, package install, or real LLM/API/provider call is enabled. Secret/config/session and raw private dumps remain blocked. Browser/desktop/shell/cloud/MCP execution remains locked. Phase 12L narrow approved new `.md`/`.txt` creation remains the only real file write path. Next phase is Phase 29 Public Demo / Release.

## Phase 29 Public Demo / Release

Phase 29 Public Demo / Release is complete after this pass. It adds eight read/status capabilities under `release.*` for status, demo profile, command guide, capability map, safety proof, readiness, limitations, and verification guidance. Every capability returns deterministic local demo/report/status text only.

No publishing, uploading, package release, installer creation, commit, tag, push, source edit, shell/test/package/git execution, arbitrary filesystem access, live provider call, or tool execution is enabled. Secret/config/session and raw private dumps remain blocked. Browser/desktop/shell/cloud/MCP execution remains locked. CodingAgent, News Dashboard, and Voice retain their Phase 28/27/22 boundaries. Phase 12L narrow approved new `.md`/`.txt` creation remains the only real file write path.

Phase 29 handed off to Phase 30 Release Candidate Hardening. The current next safe step is user-approved commit execution outside Eva or a separate explicit commit-approval phase.
