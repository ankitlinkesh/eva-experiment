# Eva Phase 30 Commit Plan

Phase 30 Release Candidate Hardening / Commit Planning is complete after this pass.

Phase 30 is report/status/planning only. The commit plan is text only and never stages files, creates branches, commits, tags, pushes, publishes, uploads, or runs shell commands through Eva.

## Logical review groups

1. Core safety and execution gates.
2. Browser and desktop observation/control-gate foundations.
3. Voice, news, coding, public-demo, and release-candidate modules.
4. Public documentation, limitations, readiness, and safety proof.
5. Focused verifiers and master verifier registration.

One checkpoint commit is recommended after user review because the Phase 30 status surfaces, documentation, and verifier expectations are interdependent.

Suggested message: `Add Phase 30 release candidate hardening`.

## Pre-commit review

- Run compileall, the focused Phase 30 verifier, and master quick/full profiles.
- Run `git diff --check` and inspect `git status --short` without staging.
- Confirm ignored environment filenames remain excluded and unread.
- Confirm execution locks and the Phase 12L write boundary remain unchanged.
- Require explicit user approval before any later commit.

Rollback note: discard nothing before review; the uncommitted diff remains the source of truth.

## Phase 30 boundary

For Phase 30, no git add/commit/tag/push was performed and no publishing/uploading was performed. No provider SDKs or package installs were added. No real LLM/API/provider calls happen.

No `.env`, `.env.local`, secrets, tokens, cookies, passwords, browser sessions, or config contents are read. Arbitrary file reads/writes are blocked. Browser/desktop/shell/cloud/MCP execution and tool execution remain locked.

CodingAgent remains preview/report/status only. News remains local/mock or safe-read-only. Voice remains a locked/mock foundation. Phase 12L narrow approved new `.md`/`.txt` creation remains the only real write path.

Next safe step: user-approved commit execution outside Eva or a separate explicit commit-approval phase.
