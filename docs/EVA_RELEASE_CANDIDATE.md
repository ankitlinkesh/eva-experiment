# Eva Release Candidate

Phase 30 Release Candidate Hardening / Commit Planning is complete after this pass.

Release-candidate ID: `eva-phase30-rc1`. Audited baseline: `4f364d2` on `main`, matching `origin/main` before the Phase 30 patch.

Phase 30 is report/status/planning only. The commit plan is text only. Its reports group the dirty tree, record hardening findings, expose a checklist, and describe readiness without staging or executing Git.

Commands:

- `eva rc status`
- `eva rc manifest`
- `eva rc commit plan`
- `eva rc hardening report`
- `eva rc checklist`
- `eva rc readiness`
- `eva rc safety proof`
- `eva rc verification`

## Phase 30 boundary

For Phase 30, no git add/commit/tag/push was performed and no publishing/uploading was performed. No provider SDKs or package installs were added. No real LLM/API/provider calls happen.

No `.env`, `.env.local`, secrets, tokens, cookies, passwords, browser sessions, or config contents are read. Arbitrary file reads/writes are blocked. Browser/desktop/shell/cloud/MCP execution and tool execution remain locked.

CodingAgent remains preview/report/status only. News remains local/mock or safe-read-only. Voice remains a locked/mock foundation. Phase 12L narrow approved new `.md`/`.txt` creation remains the only real write path.

Next safe step: user-approved commit execution outside Eva or a separate explicit commit-approval phase.
