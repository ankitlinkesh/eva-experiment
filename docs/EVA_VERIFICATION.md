# Eva Verification

Phase 12K adds a fast verification entrypoint for local Eva development.

Phase 12L adds `scripts/verify_eva_file_agent_real_apply_gate.py` for the narrow create-new-text-file real apply gate.

Phase 12O adds `scripts/verify_eva_project_reality_workflow.py` for project inspection, proof/done checks, broken-status wording, natural `eva ask` routing, capabilities, planner/team review, and Control Center project/reality summaries.

Phase 12P adds `scripts/verify_eva_control_center_v1.py` for the upgraded Control Center summaries, locked/enabled feature commands, natural `eva ask` routing, capabilities, planner/team review, and status-only safety boundaries.

Phase 12Q adds `scripts/verify_eva_work_sessions_audit.py` for local WorkSession creation, sanitized timeline events, `eva ask` audit logging, Control Center WorkSession panels, capability/schema/resource metadata, planner/team review integration, and forbidden-execution checks.

Phase 12R adds `scripts/verify_eva_golden_workflow_e2e.py` for the natural FileAgent project-note workflow across approval, sandbox, exact Phase 12L real create, verification, WorkSession timeline, Control Center status, and guarded rollback.

Phase 12S adds `scripts/verify_eva_phase12_ready.py` for final readiness, summary, limits, proof commands, capability/resource/schema metadata, planner/team-review routing, and clean status output.

## Commands

Quick smoke profile:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\verify_eva_all.py --quick
```

Full profile:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\verify_eva_all.py --full
```

List profiles:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\verify_eva_all.py --list
```

Optional per-script timeout:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\verify_eva_all.py --quick --timeout 90
```

## Profiles

The quick profile runs only the fast Phase 12 smoke checks, golden workflow checks, and Control Center checks.

The full profile runs the broader Phase 12/FileAgent/planner verifier set. It is meant for checkpoint readiness.

The full profile includes the Phase 12O project/reality workflow verifier and the Phase 12P Control Center verifier.

The full profile includes the Phase 12R golden workflow E2E verifier.

The full and quick profiles include the Phase 12L real apply verifier. That verifier creates only isolated test `.md`/`.txt` files under allowed safe folders and removes only files it created.

## Chat Status

Eva can show verification status and manual commands:

- `eva smoke status`
- `eva verify quick command`
- `eva verify full command`
- `eva phase 12 status`
- `eva phase 12 ready`
- `eva phase 12 summary`
- `eva phase 12 limits`
- `eva phase 12 proof`
- `eva ux status`
- `eva project inspect`
- `eva project reality check`
- `eva project proof`
- `eva done check`
- `eva control center`
- `eva control center summary`
- `eva locked features`
- `eva enabled features`
- `eva sessions status`
- `eva sessions recent`
- `eva session latest`
- `eva audit timeline`
- `eva work status`
- `eva workflow golden proof`
- `eva workflow golden test plan`
- `eva next safe step`
- `eva ask run quick check`
- `eva ask how do I verify Eva`

These commands do not run shell commands from chat. They only return friendly status text or the command for the user/developer to run manually.

## Control Center

The Control Center has a Phase 12 Health / Verification section. It shows the smoke verifier, quick/full commands, latest dashboard-local status, project/reality summary, workflow state, WorkSession audit status, enabled real action, locked features, and next safe step. The dashboard does not run verifiers automatically.

The Phase 12S readiness commands show the same proof posture from chat: readiness is a status claim until the quick/full verifier commands pass in the current terminal. These commands print evidence surfaces and manual commands only; they do not execute subprocesses.

## Safety Boundary

Verification UX and WorkSession audit UX do not enable MCP, Playwright, PyAutoGUI, browser control, desktop control, screen watching, terminal execution, package installs, cloud calls, external sending, or broad file writes. Phase 12L real apply remains limited to approved create-new-text-file operations under `docs/` or `samples/`.

The verifier checks provider metadata, mock-only route preview, fallback/limit/degraded-mode policy, mock structured-output validation, direct commands, `eva ask` routing, Control Center, capability/resource/schema metadata, and planner/team-review routing. It also asserts that no live LLM/API/network call, secret/config read, provider SDK, tool execution, browser, desktop, shell, package, MCP, PyAutoGUI, or Playwright execution was added.

Phase 15B verification uses `scripts/verify_eva_llm_router_fallbacks_limits.py` plus the master quick/full profiles. It covers deterministic fallback/degraded/limit/audit simulations and confirms live calls and LLM-output tool execution remain locked before Phase 15C Structured Output Validation Hardening.

Unsafe LLM-like output fails safely; Phase 12L narrow approved new `.md`/`.txt` creation remains the only real write path. Next: Phase 16 Context Assembly Engine.

Phase 15E verification uses `scripts/verify_eva_llm_red_team_evidence_lock.py` in both quick and full profiles.

# Phase 29 Public Demo / Release

Run `scripts/verify_eva_public_demo_release.py` directly and through both master profiles. Phase 29 Public Demo / Release is complete after this pass when the focused, quick, and full checks pass. The verifier covers the release-demo model, profile, commands, capability map, safety proof, readiness, limitations, verification guidance, commands, `eva ask`, Control Center, AI OS, capabilities, resource mappings, tool schemas, planner, team review, README, public docs, phase docs, and master-profile inclusion.

The verifier performs no publishing, uploading, packaging, installer creation, commit, tag, push, provider SDK import, package install, shell/test/package/git execution, arbitrary filesystem access through the release-demo layer, live LLM/API/provider/network call, browser/desktop control, source edit, unrestricted crawl, secret/config/session/private-dump read, or tool execution. Phase 12L narrow approved new `.md`/`.txt` creation remains the only real file write path.

Next safe step: Release Candidate Hardening / optional user-approved commit planning.
