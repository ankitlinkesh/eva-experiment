"""A bounded command runner (Phase 74).

THIS IS NOT A SHELL, and the distinction is the entire safety argument.

`ActionType.SHELL_ACTION` is hard-blocked in both gates -- permission_gate.py
says "Arbitrary shell execution is blocked by default" and tool_gate.py refuses
it outright -- and Phase 74 does NOT weaken that. Nothing here loosens the
shell classification; this module is a different thing that happens to run a
process:

  * NO SHELL. `subprocess.run` is called with an argument LIST and
    `shell=False`, always. There is no interpreter to expand `;`, `|`, `&&`,
    backticks, `$(...)`, globs or redirection -- those characters arrive at the
    program as literal argv entries.
  * A FIXED EXECUTABLE ALLOWLIST, declared in source. An unlisted program
    cannot be named, so this is not "run what you like, minus a denylist".
  * A SUBCOMMAND ALLOWLIST per program, read-only by design. `git status` is
    listed; `git push`, `git commit`, `git reset` and `git clean` are not, so a
    bounded run cannot mutate the repository.
  * A DANGEROUS-FLAG DENYLIST, which is the part that is easy to get wrong.
    An executable allowlist alone is NOT sufficient: several perfectly ordinary
    programs will execute arbitrary code for you if asked the right way --
    `git -c core.pager=<cmd>`, `git --exec-path=<dir>`, `git diff --ext-diff`,
    `git ... --upload-pack=<cmd>`. Allowlisting `git` while ignoring its flags
    would hand back exactly the arbitrary execution the hard block exists to
    prevent, wearing a different name.
  * BOUNDED TIME AND OUTPUT. A timeout the caller cannot raise past a ceiling,
    and truncated stdout/stderr, so a runaway or a flood cannot hang the agent
    or blow up a context window.
  * A CONFINED WORKING DIRECTORY, resolved once and never taken from arguments.

OUTPUT IS UNTRUSTED. Command output is content, not instruction: a file in the
repo, a branch name, or a commit message can say anything at all. `as_text()`
carries that marker, in the same shape as delegated sub-task results (Phase 73).

Every registered tool is RED for every existing role automatically (Phase 72
fails closed by construction), so no delegated sub-task can reach this.
