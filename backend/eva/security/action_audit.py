"""The auto-allow audit — no tool becomes unguarded by accident (Phase 51).

Two real bugs shipped with the same root cause, found within an hour of each
other by probing rather than by the 79-verifier suite:

  * ``capture_screen`` / ``analyze_screen`` declared no ``action_type``. It
    silently defaulted to ``SAFE_LOCAL_READ``, which is ALLOW-class, so they
    screenshotted the whole screen to disk with no confirmation — while the
    correctly-typed ``screen.observe`` sat gated and unreachable.
  * ``desktop_observe`` was ALLOW-class with a caller-supplied
    ``explicit_screen_intent`` flag that unlocked pixel capture — the model
    authorizing itself.

The lesson is not "we mislabelled two tools". It is that **the safe-looking
default is the dangerous one**: forget a field, get auto-allow, and nothing in
the suite notices. A permission gate whose default is "allow" fails open.

This module closes that hole. ``AUDITED_SAFE_LOCAL_READ`` is the *explicit,
reviewed* list of tools permitted to be auto-allowed. The Phase 51 verifier
fails if any tool is ``SAFE_LOCAL_READ`` without appearing here — so a new tool
that omits ``action_type`` breaks the build instead of quietly becoming
unguarded. Adding a name here is a deliberate act with a reason attached, which
is exactly what was missing.

Being listed here is a claim: *this tool reads only non-sensitive local state,
touches no pixels, mutates nothing, and reaches no network.*

# --- Workspace / code reads. ------------------------------------------------
# REVIEWED DECISION, not an oversight. These read file *contents*, which is
# literally a PRIVACY_FILE_READ. They stay allow-class because:
#   1. they are hard-restricted by the `_safe_path` allowlist to the project and
#      Documents/Desktop/Downloads, and it denies `.env*`, `.git`, `*.sqlite3`
#      and key files, so secrets are unreachable through them;
#   2. inspecting the user's own project is the assistant's core job — gating
#      every "search my code" behind a typed confirmation would make the
#      workspace tools unusable and train the user to approve reflexively, which
#      is worse for safety than the read itself.
# The underlying judgment is an asymmetry between broad and narrow reads:
# an arbitrary-path read (any file, anywhere the OS user can reach) should be
# gated; a narrow, allowlist-bounded read of the user's own project should
# not. Phase 66 found the arbitrary-path tool that used to make this contrast
# concrete, `file.read_text`, had no caller anywhere in the product -- the
# planner and console only ever routed reads through the allowlisted tools
# below -- so Phase 70 deleted it rather than let a stranded duplicate keep
# masquerading as "the gated alternative". The judgment this comment records
# does not depend on that specific tool existing; the workspace tools below
# would stay allow-class for the same two reasons even with nothing broader
# registered at all.
