"""Self-improvement — Eva learns new skills from what worked (Phase 47).

The capstone, built so that improving cannot mean escalating:

    **A learned skill COMPOSES tools that already exist. Eva never writes code.**

Learning reads the Phase 36 flight recorder for tool sequences that already
happened, repeatedly, and worked, and proposes naming them. A proposal is inert
until a human approves it, and running one is just ``ToolRegistry.run`` per step
— so the gate governs every action exactly as it always did. A skill is
convenience, never capability.
