"""Post-condition verification — the heart of verification-first execution (Phase 38).

Until now a tool call was reported "done" the moment its handler returned
without raising. That conflates *ran* with *worked*: a write handler can return
a tidy ``{"ok": true}`` while the file on disk is unchanged. Phase 38 closes that
gap by giving every action a **declared post-condition** and checking it against
real state *after* the handler runs, so Eva never claims an unproven effect.

The load-bearing idea here is **provenance** — how much we actually know:

  * ``independent`` — verified against real OS/file state we read ourselves
    (the file exists / is gone / contains the expected text, or — Phase 64 —
    the real foreground window matches the one we just tried to focus). This
    is proof.
  * ``self_reported`` — we only trust the tool's own success flag (e.g. a local
    read returning a dict). Fine for reads, but not proof of a world change.
  * ``observed`` — reserved for a local UI/network effect (a click, a
    keystroke, a launch) independently confirmed via perception. Nothing in
    this codebase can do that yet, so no verification method currently
    produces this provenance (see Phase 64: it used to be claimed anyway —
    see ``unverified`` below).
  * ``unverified`` — no verification method applies, *or* one applies in
    principle but nothing here can independently check it (e.g. "does this
    screen now show the typed text") — either way we say so plainly rather
    than borrow confidence from the tool's own self-report.

Only ``independent`` failure is treated as a hard "the action did not happen";
the weaker classes never *upgrade* confidence into a false claim of success.
Everything here is pure (no registry import → no import cycle) and fail-safe.

Phase 64 note: before this phase, every ``_OBSERVED_METHODS`` entry (including
``app_window_active``) reported ``provenance="observed"`` with ``verified``
silently borrowed from the tool's own self-reported ``ok`` — so a tool that
itself lied about success (e.g. the old ``focus_window``, see
``eva.desktop.windows``) had that lie laundered into an apparent
independent-looking "verified" confirmation. ``app_window_active`` now has a
real independent check (below); everything else in ``_OBSERVED_METHODS``
instead honestly reports ``unverified`` and ``verified=False`` — it was never
actually observed, so it no longer claims to have been.

Phase 64 follow-up (the mirror-image regression): giving ``app_window_active``
a real independent check initially broke ``app.open``, which also declared
that method. "Opened" is not "focused" — an app can launch correctly without
taking the foreground (another process holding the foreground lock is the
*ordinary* case, not an edge case) — so a real foreground check made a
perfectly successful launch independently fail, demoting ``ok`` to ``False``
for work that actually worked. The fix is **not** a name heuristic bolted onto
``app_window_active`` (that already happened once for ``app.close_request``
below, and piling a third case onto it was exactly the wrong direction): each
tool now declares the ``verification_method`` that actually describes its own
postcondition — ``app.open`` → ``app_window_open`` (a window now exists,
independent of focus), ``app.focus`` → ``app_window_active`` (foreground IS
the postcondition), ``app.close_request`` → ``command_result_success``
(nothing here independently checks "window now absent" yet, so it declares
what it actually gets rather than routing through a method that does not
apply). No tool-name sniffing is needed for any of the three.

Phase 70 note: ``app.open`` and ``app.close_request`` no longer exist as
registered tools — Phase 66 found neither had any caller in the shipped
product (``open_app``/``close_app`` were what the console and planner
actually routed to), so both dotted duplicates were deleted rather than left
stranded. Before deleting ``app.open``, its ``app_window_open`` postcondition
(the real, independent check described above) was moved onto ``open_app`` so
the routed path did not lose verification in the process. That move needed a
fix here that was initially missed: ``open_app``'s args_schema advertises
``app``, but its handler also accepts ``app_name`` — and the console, its
primary routed caller, uses exactly that spelling. Reading only ``app``
recorded no target, making the freshly-moved postcondition INERT on the one
path it was moved to protect, and reporting a successful "open chrome" as
``verified=False``/``unverified`` — the Phase 64 regression shape all over
again. ``_first`` below now reads every argument name the tool accepts; a
postcondition that reads fewer verifies nothing while looking correct.
``app.focus`` (``app_window_active``) is
unaffected and still declares its own postcondition directly, as does
``close_app``, which still declares ``command_result_success`` like
``app.close_request`` did (nothing independently checks "window now absent"
for it either).
