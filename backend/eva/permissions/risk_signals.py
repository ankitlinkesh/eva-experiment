"""Argument-aware risk escalation — the mirror of Phase 42 (Phase 55).

Phase 42 learned to *remove* friction (auto-allow an action the user has approved
many times) and hemmed that in on every side, because removing friction is
dangerous. This is the other half: *adding* friction, which is always safe, so it
is unconditional.

The gap it closes is the one the whole project keeps re-learning: **the gate
classifies per-TOOL, blind to the ARGUMENTS.** ``file.list_dir`` is allow-class,
so listing ``C:\\Windows\\System32`` or ``~/.ssh`` auto-runs and quietly
enumerates a sensitive directory; ``file.copy`` classifies a copy into a system
folder exactly like a copy into a scratch dir. The static class cannot see where
the action points. This layer looks at the call's actual arguments and, when a
target is sensitive, raises the friction the static class deserves.

Two hard invariants make it safe by construction:

  * **It can only ever escalate.** allow -> confirm -> override, never the
    reverse, and it never touches ``hard_block`` (a terminal policy decision).
    A bug here can only ask for *more* confirmation, never less — it fails safe.
  * **It is proportionate.** A *reading* action on a sensitive target escalates
    to ``confirm`` (ask first); a *mutating* action escalates to ``override``
    (the strongest interactive friction). Reading your secrets folder should ask;
    writing into a system directory should demand the override phrase.

Escalation strictly dominates the Phase 42 trust de-escalation: an action the
risk layer raises is never then auto-allowed for having been approved before.

Pure and deterministic: string/path reasoning only, no filesystem access (so a
``..`` traversal toward a system dir is caught by the literal path text, not by
resolving it on disk). The sensitive-marker list is curated, not exhaustive — a
miss is merely "no extra confirmation", never an unsafe allow.
