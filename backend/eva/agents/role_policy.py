"""Per-role tool policy (Phase 72).

The permission gate classifies per TOOL, globally: `file.write_text` costs the
same no matter who asks. That is the right default for a single actor, but it
cannot express "a research sub-task may read the web and must never touch the
screen" -- which is exactly the containment a delegated sub-agent needs, because
a research role reads UNTRUSTED CONTENT and a page can ask it to do anything.

This module adds the missing dimension: role x tool -> tier.

    GREEN   this role may attempt the tool. The gate still classifies it
            normally -- an override-class tool stays override-class.
    ORANGE  this role may attempt it, but friction is raised one step
            (allow -> confirm -> override), regardless of trust calibration.
    RED     this role may not call it at all. Refused before the gate is even
            consulted, and surfaced to the user.

THE INVARIANT, inherited from Phase 55 and the reason this is safe to apply
unconditionally: a role tier can ONLY ADD friction, never remove it. GREEN means
"not restricted by role", NOT "pre-approved". If a role could mark a tool green
and skip confirmation, this file would be a self-authorization channel exactly
like the `confirmed`/`_approved`/`content_args` kwargs that `registry.run`
strips -- so GREEN deliberately has no power to lower anything.

FAIL-CLOSED BY CONSTRUCTION: a role declares only what it MAY use; everything
else is RED. Registering a new tool therefore makes it unavailable to every
existing role until someone decides otherwise, rather than silently becoming
available to all of them. This is the Phase 51 lesson (a missing `action_type`
used to mean auto-allow) applied at the role layer, but by construction rather
than by a build check.

RED IS FIXED IN SOURCE and is not runtime-overridable. There is no "approve
this once" path, because the whole point is that untrusted content must not be
able to ASK for one -- a request to lift a restriction is precisely what an
injected page would produce. The escape hatch is the human running the command
themselves from the typed console, which is already this project's trust
boundary for rule creation (Phase 54) and form filling (Phase 58).

Tool names here are cross-checked against the live registry by
scripts/verify_eva_phase72_role_policy.py. A typo must not silently degrade to
RED: a misspelled GREEN entry would leave the intended tool denied while the
policy still looked permissive.
