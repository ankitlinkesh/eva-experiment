"""GUI grounding — turning a screen into things you can actually click (Phase 56).

For the whole project NOVA has been blind to GUIs: it could grab a screenshot but
extracted nothing from it, ``ui_locator.locate_by_text_hint`` was a ``return
None`` stub, and ``screen.click`` refuses raw coordinates and demands a verified
``UiTarget`` that nothing could produce. So "click Submit" / "fill the email
field" had no path. This is the bridge that was missing: text label -> a specific
on-screen target with coordinates and a confidence.

Two design commitments:

  * **The tree is injectable.** The real backend walks the Windows UIAutomation
    accessibility tree (``uiautomation``), which gives exact element rectangles,
    labels and roles — deterministic, no vision model, no tokens. But every
    function takes an optional ``provider``/element list, so the ranking logic is
    tested against fabricated trees with no real desktop, and the whole thing
    degrades to "no targets" (exactly today's behaviour) when the library is
    absent or the flag is off. Install ``uiautomation`` and set
    ``EVA_GUI_GROUNDING_ENABLED=1`` to give NOVA real eyes.

  * **Clicking the WRONG thing is the harm to design against.** The matcher is
    conservative: it strips role words from the query, scores the label, applies
    a role-affinity factor, and zeroes out anything disabled or off-screen. The
    caller still enforces a confidence floor (``screen.click`` wants >= 0.75), so
    a weak match yields *no* click rather than a wrong one.

Pure and fail-safe throughout: any error anywhere yields "no targets", never a
guess, and never raises into the gate.

# -- browser origin binding (Phase 67) ---------------------------------------
#
# The gap this closes: grounding matches LABELS, not origin. A hostile page
# with a field literally named "Email" gets `@vault:email` filled into it --
# the label match cannot tell "the right kind of field" from "the right
# SITE". Phase 63/64 re-verify the foreground WINDOW before every field (a
# focus-theft / wrong-window defense); this is the missing identity half --
# the right-looking window may simply be the wrong site.
#
# Chrome and Edge expose their address bar as an Edit control in the SAME
# accessibility tree this module already walks, named "Address and search
# bar" in English locales, whose ValuePattern holds the current page's URL.
# That control is deliberately the trust anchor here: page content can
# rewrite its own <title> (see form_filler._window_identity's comment) and
# its own DOM, but it cannot touch the browser's own chrome -- the address
# bar is the one place a page cannot lie. Reading it from the tree is also
# non-invasive, unlike `chrome_copy_current_url` (Ctrl+L/Ctrl+C), which
# steals focus and clobbers the clipboard mid-form -- exactly the kind of
# side effect this module has avoided everywhere else.
#
# Two honesty notes, worth restating anywhere this gets used or described:
#   * This is the domain the BROWSER CHROME reports, not the DOM's true
#     origin. It is the right trust anchor (page content cannot alter browser
#     chrome), but it is a proxy, not the real thing -- never claim otherwise.
#   * Only Chrome/Edge are known to expose this control under this name.
#     Other browsers, and kiosk/fullscreen modes that hide the omnibox
#     entirely, have no readable origin -- see is_browser_window() below for
