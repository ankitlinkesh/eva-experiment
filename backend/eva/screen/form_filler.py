"""Filling a form — chaining locate -> click -> type, safely (Phase 58).

Phase 56 made a single field clickable by label and Phase 57 made the screen
observable. This composes them into the thing people actually ask for: "fill in
this form." For each (label, value) it clicks the field to focus it and types the
value — going through the ordinary gated tools every step, so it inherits the
confidence gate, the real-input gate, and the Phase 55 risk escalation. It adds
no new authority; it is pure orchestration over tools NOVA already has.

Three safety commitments:

  * **It never records the values.** A form value is often a password or a
    payment detail. A :class:`FillStep` carries only the field label, whether the
    value looked like a live secret, and the outcome — never the value itself.
    Nothing here logs, traces, or returns the typed text.
  * **It stops rather than blunders.** The moment a field cannot be found (or a
    click/type is refused, e.g. real input is off), it stops and reports where —
    it does not keep typing values into the wrong places on a half-understood
    form.
  * **It is driven only from the trusted console.** Like NL rule creation, this
    is reached from a typed fast-command, never wired as a planner tool — so
    untrusted content (Phase 40) cannot make NOVA type attacker-chosen values
    into a form.

The executor is injectable, so the orchestration is tested without a real
desktop; the default routes every step through the real ToolRegistry gate.
