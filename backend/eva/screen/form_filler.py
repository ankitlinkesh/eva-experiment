"""Filling a form — chaining locate -> click -> type, safely (Phase 58).

Phase 56 made a single field clickable by label and Phase 57 made the screen
observable. This composes them into the thing people actually ask for: "fill in
this form." For each (label, value) it clicks the field to focus it and types the
value — going through the ordinary gated tools every step, so it inherits the
confidence gate, the real-input gate, and the Phase 55 risk escalation. It adds
no new authority; it is pure orchestration over tools NOVA already has.

Three safety commitments:

  * **It never records the values.** A form value is often a password or a
    payment detail. A :class:`FillStep` carries only the field label, whether the
    value looked like a live secret, and the outcome — never the value itself.
    Nothing here logs, traces, or returns the typed text.
  * **It stops rather than blunders.** The moment a field cannot be found (or a
    click/type is refused, e.g. real input is off), it stops and reports where —
    it does not keep typing values into the wrong places on a half-understood
    form.
  * **It is driven only from the trusted console.** Like NL rule creation, this
    is reached from a typed fast-command, never wired as a planner tool — so
    untrusted content (Phase 40) cannot make NOVA type attacker-chosen values
    into a form.

The executor is injectable, so the orchestration is tested without a real
desktop; the default routes every step through the real ToolRegistry gate.

Phase 62 adds a second path alongside ``fill_form``: staging. ``screen.type_text``
is confirm-class, so gating each field individually (as ``fill_form`` does) stalls
a real submission at field 1 asking to confirm typing. ``stage_form`` lets the
trusted console record a whole form (fields -- literal or ``@vault:name``
references -- plus what to do when done) as one ``StagedForm`` behind an opaque
``spec_id``; the gated tool ``screen.submit_form`` (see ``screen_tools.py``) takes
only that id and, after a single approval, performs the whole form. See
``describe_staged_form`` for the value-free manifest the approval reads.

# -- staging a form for one-shot, gated submission (Phase 62) ---------------
#
# `fill_form` above gates every keystroke individually, and `screen.type_text`
# is confirm-class -- so a real call stalls at field 1 asking to confirm typing,
# forever, one field at a time. The fix is to gate the whole submission ONCE:
# the trusted console stages a form (fields, values or vault refs, and what to
# do when done) and gets back an opaque `spec_id`. The gated tool
# `screen.submit_form` takes ONLY that id; the gate gets to see the value-free
# manifest (`describe_staged_form`) and approves the id, never a value. After
# approval the handler pops the staged form (single-use) and does every
# click/type/submit itself, calling the screen_tools functions directly rather
# than re-entering the gate -- see the loud comment in screen_tools.py.
#
# This store mirrors `eva.security.tool_gate._PENDING_CALLS`: a module-level
# dict, single-use pop, and a TTL so a stale id cannot be replayed long after
# the console session that staged it is gone.
