"""Executable spec for per-role tool containment (Phase 72).

The security-facing, end-to-end invariants live in
scripts/verify_eva_phase72_role_policy.py (GREEN is not a bypass, ORANGE
survives Phase 42, role kwargs carry no authority, the refusal does not echo
arguments). This file pins the smaller units underneath them, so a regression
names the specific rule it broke rather than only failing an integration check.

The through-line: every default here points at RED. A role declares what it may
use and nothing else, so the failure mode of forgetting to declare something is
a refusal, never an unnoticed grant. That is the Phase 51 lesson (a missing
`action_type` silently meaning auto-allow) applied one layer up.
