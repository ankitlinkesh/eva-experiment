"""Executable spec for backend/eva/tools/postconditions.py (Phase 38, honesty
fixes in Phase 64).

Covers the provenance contract that makes verification-first execution honest:

  * a written file whose content really is on disk is ``independent`` proof;
  * a claimed write whose content is *not* on disk is caught, not trusted;
  * a delete's real post-condition is file-absence, even though the tool's
    declared ``verification_method`` metadata says ``file_exists``;
  * a bare self-reported read only ever earns ``self_reported`` provenance,
    never ``independent``;
  * a screen/UI effect nothing here can actually check (screen_state_changed,
    text_field_contains, url_opened, ...) is honestly ``unverified`` --
    Phase 64 found it used to claim ``provenance="observed"`` with `verified`
    silently borrowed from the tool's own self-reported ``ok``, which is
    exactly how a lying tool's lie got laundered into an apparently
    independent-looking confirmation (see the ``focus_window``/
    ``app_window_active`` tests below for the concrete case this was found
    from);
  * ``app_window_active`` (Phase 64) is the one exception: focusing a window
    genuinely IS independently checkable (read the real foreground window
    ourselves), so it gets a real ``independent`` check instead;
  * ``app_window_open`` (Phase 64 follow-up) is the mirror-image lesson:
    giving ``app_window_active`` a real check initially broke the app-open
    tool (then ``app.open``), because "opened" is not "focused" -- an app
    can launch correctly without taking the foreground. Each of
    ``app.open``/``app.focus``/``app.close_request`` (at the time) declared
    the ``verification_method`` that actually described its own
    postcondition, rather than one method growing a tool-name heuristic to
    cover three different meanings; and
  * the executor wires all of this through so an allow-class tool call
    attaches a ``verification`` dict without demoting ``ok`` unless the
    verification is both independent and failed.

Phase 70 note: ``app.open`` and ``app.close_request`` were later deleted as
unrouted duplicates of ``open_app``/``close_app`` (Phase 66 found neither
had a caller anywhere in the shipped product). ``app.open``'s
``app_window_open`` postcondition was moved onto ``open_app`` before
deletion, so the tests below that exercise it now target ``open_app`` --
same mechanism, same regression, routed tool. ``app.focus`` is untouched.
