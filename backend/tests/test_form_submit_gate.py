"""The real gate, not a stand-in for it (Phase 62).

Phase 62 fixed two defects that a fully green 90-verifier / 607-test suite
completely missed:

  * **Defect A**: ``fill_form`` called ``registry.run("screen.type_text")``
    per field. That tool is confirm-class, so the registry returned
    ``{"ok": False, "requires_confirmation": True}`` instead of typing, and
    ``fill_form`` treated that as a refusal and stopped at field 1. It could
    never fill a single form for real.
  * **Defect B**: ``_create_gated_pending`` wrote tool args into the on-disk
    ledger, so ``screen.type_text(text="hunter2")`` persisted
    ``payload_summary: "text=hunter2"`` in plaintext.

Both survived because every test that existed before this file injected a
fake executor returning ``{"ok": True}`` -- more permissive than the real
system, standing in for exactly the thing that was broken. The governing
rule here is the opposite: **injection is allowed BELOW the gate, never
ACROSS it.** Every test in this file drives the REAL ``ToolRegistry().run``
and the REAL confirmation round-trip (``handle_confirmation_command`` ->
``confirm_pending_action`` -> ``run_approved``). The only things faked are
things strictly below the tool-level gate:

  * ``eva.screen.grounding._default_provider`` -- the accessibility-tree
    reader. Faking WHICH controls exist on screen is the same category of
    substitution the rest of this project already uses for grounding tests
    (see ``test_grounding_disambiguation.py``); it is not a stand-in for the
    registry or the gate.
  * ``eva.screen.screen_controller.click`` / ``.type_text`` / ``.press`` --
    the physical pyautogui layer. Faking these is what keeps this suite from
    actually moving the mouse; nothing about the gate, the ledger, or the
    confirmation flow is touched.

``backend/tests/conftest.py``'s autouse ``eva_pending_action_ledger_path``
fixture already redirects ``EVA_PENDING_ACTION_LEDGER_PATH`` to a tmp file
for every test, so the real ledger is never touched.
