"""The auto-allow audit (Phase 51).

Both screen bypasses had one root cause: omit ``action_type`` on a ToolSpec and
it silently inherits ``SAFE_LOCAL_READ``, which is ALLOW-class. The dangerous
default is the *invisible* one — nothing failed, nothing warned, the tool just
ran unguarded. These tests make that impossible to reintroduce quietly.
