"""Executable spec for Phase 86 (gate execution honesty).

Found by driving gated tools through real ledger approval:

Bug A -- a successful screen capture was reported as a failure. `_capture_screen`
returned a dict with no `ok` key, but `_with_execution` in confirmation.py decides
success via `executed.get("ok")`. So approving `capture_screen` fell into the
failure branch and answered "I confirmed `act_...`, but execution did not
complete." even though the screenshot was taken and saved.

Bug B -- a gated call missing a required arg crashed on approval. `screen.observe`
requires `reason` in its args_schema, but `ToolRegistry.run` never validates
args_schema before creating the gated pending. On approval, `run_approved` reached
`self._invoke(spec, dict(stored["args"]))` and `spec.handler(**args)` raised
`TypeError: missing 1 required positional argument: 'reason'` -- an unhandled
crash after the user already approved the action.

Pinned:
  1. Approving `capture_screen` reports success end to end (real ledger flow).
  2. `_capture_screen()` itself returns `ok: True`.
  3. `run_approved` on a malformed stored call (missing required arg) returns a
     clean `ok: False` + error, and does not raise.

# A tiny fake JPEG. The capture is stubbed so these tests are DETERMINISTIC:

# when the display cannot be grabbed (screen locked, under load) -- and Fix B
# then correctly turns that raise into ok:False, which is exactly the "did not
# complete" the flaky first version of this test tripped over during a long full
# suite run. The behaviour under test is "a SUCCESSFUL capture reports success",
# so we make the capture deterministically succeed rather than depend on live
# hardware. (Capture actually failing -> honest failure is a separate, correct path.)
