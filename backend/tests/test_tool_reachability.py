"""Pytest coverage for Phase 66: no registered tool may be stranded.

This is the pytest-visible companion to
``scripts/verify_eva_phase66_tool_reachability.py`` -- see that module's
docstring for the full invariant, method, and its documented limitations.
In short: every tool in ``ToolRegistry._tools`` must be reachable either
through ``planner_specs()`` (under the union of default and
``EVA_V2_PLAYWRIGHT_ENABLED=true``), or through an exact string-literal
reference in a production ``backend/eva/**/*.py`` module other than
``registry.py`` or ``roadmap/catalog.py`` (both excluded -- see below and
the verifier's docstring for why a declarative catalog OF tools cannot
prove anything routes to them).

REACHABLE MEANS ROUTED, NOT MERELY CALLABLE. Every registered tool is
already callable in principle through ``/api/tools/{tool_name}``, which
calls ``tools.run(tool_name, **body)`` for any name at all. That is exactly
how ``voice.listen_once`` and ``app.focus`` shipped stranded for phases --
both were callable in principle the whole time. This suite checks whether
something FIXED in the product chooses to call a tool for a real situation,
not whether a generic pass-through could reach it if asked.

HOW THIS DIFFERS FROM test_planner_reachability.py in this same directory:
that file asserts the opposite, security-facing direction -- that
``screen.*``/``web.*``/``mcp.*`` tools stay OUT of the planner by default
(and ``screen.*`` permanently, regardless of flags). This file asserts that
nothing REGISTERED is stranded from every production path -- a tool can
correctly stay planner-invisible forever (like ``screen.click``) while still
needing a production caller to pass here. Both are true at once and neither
subsumes the other; ``test_known_planner_only_and_source_only_tools_are_both_covered``
below exercises exactly that complementary relationship using
``screen.click`` as the concrete example.

THE PINNED FOUR, THEN DELETED: this verifier's first version excluded only
``registry.py`` and counted a ``roadmap/catalog.py`` entry as a valid
reference. That masked two genuinely stranded tools (``app.open``,
``file.patch_text``) behind their own catalog entry, on top of the two it
did catch (``app.close_request``, ``file.read_text``) -- the exact
laundering pattern this phase exists to catch, in a new costume. All four
were pinned in ``EXPECTED_UNREACHABLE`` rather than deleted at the time, in
case a future phase wired one up on purpose. Phase 70 revisited that call:
none ever was wired up, each still had a confirmed working counterpart
(``close_app``, ``open_app``, ``file.write_text``, ``workspace_read_file``
respectively), and ``app.open``'s one load-bearing property -- Phase 64's
accurate ``app_window_open`` postcondition -- was moved onto ``open_app``
before all four were deleted outright, registry entries and all.
``EXPECTED_UNREACHABLE`` is empty as of Phase 70 and ``EXPECTED_TOOL_COUNT``
dropped from 104 to 100. The mutation tests further down are the ones that
matter most: they prove the detector still actually fires on an *empty*
exemption dict (not just that it happens to be quiet today), which is
exactly the failure mode an empty allowlist invites -- being silently
mistaken for "nothing is checked".
